## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used Boston and Seattle's data to answer the following questions:

1: How can you compare the reviews in both cities ?
2: What aspects of a listing influences the price in both cities?
3: How can we predict the price?
4: How do prices vary through the year in both cities ? when is the season and off season in both cities?

The full set of files related to this project are available [here](https://github.com/Zainy1453/Project-ND-1.git) 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  One is predictive and two of the notebooks are  exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that has useful functions defined which were used within the 3 notebooks. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@zainy1453/boston-vs-seattle-an-airbnb-showdown-dd17d1698460).
