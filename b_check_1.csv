0,-1,"De kamer wordt verhuurd via een ""self-check in"" systeem. Dat betekent dat wij tijdens ons verblijf Izzy niet hebben ontmoet. Het systeem werkte prima. De kamer was zoals op de foto, alleen het bed stond nu haaks op de muur. Het huis bevindt zich in een Latijns-Amerikaanse buurt en is makkelijk te bereiken vanaf het metrostation Airport. Je bent binnen een paar haltes in het centrum van Boston. Het enige minpunt aan de locatie is dat je altijd de metro moet gebruiken en niet naar het centrum kan lopen. "
1,-2,"Nothing like ""a private room"" it's an outdated / renovation overdue house in a strange area/location. Room was dusty (Floor), staircase to the room in the basement was tiny. Somebody used the wash-machine (basement.....) at 1:45. As there wasn't an air conditioning, we had to leave windows open and got woken up often by either passing cars (windows face to the street) or talking people. Cut it short : the house is used to rent out the rooms, the friendly caring lady is taking care about things but the whole thing is commercial. Better add some money and go into a real hotel. Price isn't cheap either. Never again ! It's an abuse of Airbnb ! "
2,-3,"nothing what I expected !
we start from the position..the house is in a very bad boston district where there is nothing and there live exclusively Latinos (hispanic district) ! the metro is a 10 min walk but if you come back late at night you have to go for strength to a park where there are not recommended subjects . we had always come back soon because we were afraid something happened to us ! neighborhood dirty, ugly people , no restaurant !
as it regards the room was in the basement ... with a small WC designed in under 1 meter scale .
all very dirty and very poorly maintained.
nobody helped us by giving us indications
terrible experience ."
3,-1,The instruction was complicated but overall was okay. They process of getting & returning the key took us some time. 
4,-1,"Overall a very good air bnb experience. The one issue we had was that the window sills and a lot of the tables/desks and bedroom bench were dusty and there were quite some bugs and tiny house spiders and spider webs, but not a big problem as it just requires a little more thorough cleaning. The beds, sheets, and bathrooms were very clean. Greg is also very quick to respond to messages and the apartment is easily accessible through cab and public transportation.  "
5,-2,The listing was lovely and in a great location. It was smaller than the listing pictures showed but only the kitchen was at all cramped. Saturday morning it got extremely noisy for twenty minutes at 6 am due the windows overlooking the dumpster. We also had Wifi problems that were not fixed. Ultimately did not detract from our experience much and was a lovely weekend.
6,-4,"If you are a Puritan this is the place for you. With absolute bare walls and an extra mattress leaning against one you will not be overwhelmed by the details. No shelves or night stands to put your stuff on. Even the wifi cables and router sit on the floor in a tangle of wires. 
The kitchen is like something out of an Eastern European flat. So cramped you can barely fit between the counter and the stove. You can only open the fridge door a quarter of the way. But it does have a gas stove. 
The bathroom has cracked plaster in the shower area and the shelf in the shower is mildewed with the laminate wood coming up. 
Our alarm clock in the morning consisted of the garbage truck at 5:45 am picking up the dumpsters outside our window (which was gone through every couple of hours through the night by street people). Then from 7:00 until just after 8:00 we got to hear the loud music of the neighbor while they got ready for the day. 
Sean is very quick to respond to questions and give information. And the location is great for getting around Boston. "
7,-1,"Please read this review carefully.  I feel it is my responsibility to give the pros and cons very clearly....

PROS
-Very cheap place to stay
-This property is a FIVE minute WALK to Fenway
-The wifi is super fast
-The water is hot

CONS
-Everything else

Let me be clear:  This place met our needs for the ""guy weekend"", which was to spend as much time at Fenway as we possibly could.  We were very appreciative of the short walk to the park, and the fast Wifi.  But, the apartment was basically a room with two mattresses on the floor, a tiny bathroom and a very, very tiny kitchen.  The air conditioner was underpowered, we could hear the footsteps of the people above us, and the garbage truck emptied the three dumpsters outside our window at 5:55 am on Saturday morning. 

In addition, the host could have spent a hundred dollars on some functioning pillows, maybe a wash cloth or two, and some blankets for the second bed....

Sean was a little hard to reach with instructions, but I don't fault him too much for it as he did say he had been travelling. 

Short version:  If you have a serious limit to your budget and want to spend your money and time on other things -- particularly Fenway -- and you don't care for much more than a mattress with some air conditioning and fast wifi, then this is your spot.   

If, however, you want anything coming close to creature comforts, then you should move on and find something else. 

I wish I was able to be more charitable, but unfortunately this is the reality of this property. "
8,-1,"Good experience.  Parking was a bit tricky; otherwise, no problems."
9,-1,"We were rather disappointed with this accommodatiion. The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied."
10,-4,"Sean met us when we arrived. He provided helpful information about the area/parking. 

I defer to Ian's June 2015 review. He nailed many of the issues I had with the rental. The apt is extremely small. It's an old, run down building. Stacked up mattresses. The place was very warm and stuffy. The a/c is underpowered. Peeling paint on ceiling. Oldish bed linens and towels. No wash cloths. Had to search for toilet paper. The place smelled. Floor was sticky. Stove had grime on burner. The sense of customer service was non-existent. 

My husband and I arrived, stayed for a few minutes and explored Bodton. Returned around 10 pm. The place was hot and smelly. We left. Dropped the keys at the lock box inconvenient and across the highway. Homeless guy sleeping nearby. Dark area. 

I requested a partial refund. Sean replied no and said the issues I brought up were not accurate. They are accurate. I do not have very high expectations but it was beyond the pale. Like visiting a frat room cleaned of clutter."
11,-1,"disgusting, disappointed, dirty. The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is ""feel like at home"", but here I can only say ""better go to the hostel/hotel"". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me. "
12,-1,"Good experience, no main complaints except had a few key issues."
13,-6,"The apartment was disappointing compared to the pictures, it was dark and old the kitchen is extremely small and the bathtub was clogged which was disguting. This came with a rude and arrogant Host which all made my worst airbnb experience."
14,-1,"I was in the department 4. The apartment was dirty, shabby walls, the bed was very uncomfortable, the shower was extremely ugly and kitchen girl. I did not like the place, it was not comfortable the stay if you wanted to be in the department. The walls in our case were dark and poorly painted. The bed was very old and uncomfortable, definitely not sleep well. The neighborhood was cute and was well described.

Estuve en el departamento 4. El departamento estaba sucio, paredes en mal estado, la cama era muy incomoda, la ducha era fea y la cocina extremadamente chica. No me gusto el lugar, no fue comoda la estadia si querias estar en el departamento. Las paredes en nuestro caso estaban de oscuro y mal pintadas. La cama era muy vieja e incomoda, definitivamente no dormiamos bien. El barrio era lindo y estuvo bien descripto."
15,-4,"Not sure what to say about this experience.  Cheap place, centrally located, but likely very unsanctioned, since you have to get the key from a lock box on a fence two doors down.  Old building, run down, paint peeling, water leaks everywhere in the bathroom when you shower.  No hair dryer (although Sean offered to bring one).  The view looks out on to a wall of graffiti and is located over the dumpster (which is an issue if you open the window and don't enjoy the smell of garbage). I've been lucky so far, but this was probably the worst air B & B place I have experienced.  "
16,-2,"I have used airbnb enough to come to expect a certain level of cleanliness of the house and timeliness of the host.  This host was disappointing on both counts.  It was very difficult to communicate with the host.  It wasn't until I texted, emailed and called that I got directions for entry.  Upon our arrival, I had to locate the key away from the building in a lock box attached to a random chain link fence.  That was my first red flag.  Upon entry, the house was filthy.  Literal piles of dust and dirt in the corners, which may not be so bad under normal circumstances, but both beds were mattresses on the floor, so we we were up close and personal with the dirt.  There were not enough linens, or towels. There was only a fitted sheet and a duvet that was much too hot!  No top sheet or blankets.  No hand towels or wash cloths.  The shower had a pile of partially used soap.  No coffee maker or blender.  All of this was the second red flag.  The clincher was when I came home and found a letter from the landlord explaining that airbnb was not legal in the building.  By then, I was very uncomfortable.  When I asked the host about the letter, he dismissed it saying he gets letters like that all the time.  The location was great, and I did expect small and old (which is was), but dirty, illegal, and understocked - not good!"
17,-1,"Voor 1 nacht was het oké. Het voldeed aan de verwachtingen (die niet heel hoog waren). 
Het was voor ons echt alleen een overnachtingsplek die goedkoper was dan alle hotels in de buurt. 
We vonden 1 nacht echter wel genoeg. "
18,-1,"L'appartement est bien situé dans un quartier dynamique. LA recherche des clés est un peu une recherche au trésor. L’appartement était trop petit pour 4, un des deux matelas est en mousse et inconfortable au sommeil. Salle de bain très sale et cuisine petite. Appartement pour 2 personnes maximum. L'appartement se situe au dessus d'un container poubelle qui attire odeur et petits insectes (quelques uns retrouvés dans la chambre rampant le long des murs). Prix un peu élevé pour la qualité et la place
"
19,-1,"L'appartement semble prévu pour accueillir des réfugiés, matelas au sol, équipements et ""décoration"" plus que sommaire. La propreté laisse à désirer, la dernière fois que nous avons vu un cafard aussi gros c'était lors d'un voyage en Inde en 1990. Il faut dire que les fenêtres donnent sur deux énormes containers à ordures. Outre la vue et les odeurs il faut subir le passage tous les deux jour du service des ordures tôt le matin, le niveau sonore de l'opération vous garantit un réveil matinal. En résumé: à fuir. "
20,-4,"I was very excited for my stay here and it could not have been more of a disaster. It was not accurately represented in the listing. The home was very old and the space was not clean. The neighborhood was sketchy. This place would be possibly fine for someone in their teens or early 20s. After staying one night here, I was able to move out per approval by Airbnb. The girls then proceeded to send me a passive aggressive, rude text message after I had left. They thought I locked one of their cats in the attic...I didnt even know there was an attic and the only cat I ever saw was the one that wouldn't leave my bed. I was left on the streets with 3 bags in the rain on my first night in Boston because I just could not stay there any longer. Cat food on the floor, a mess in the sink and in fridge...dirty dishes, dirty spoons laying around with cat food on them. The bedroom was riddled with photos of random girls. I felt like I was sharing a room with someone else. The home was old and dark and seemed to be a large house divided up so many times that there were possibly dozens of people under one roof. When I arrived, there were about 6 boys in their early 20s drinking topless outside the door. Felt like a frat party. Also this unit has a shared bathroom thats not near your bedroom, and your bedroom would be right in the living room. Very small space. The girls were out of town when I arrived and did not leave me with the internet code or any information but one towel full of cat hair on it. On the other side of the bed, there were pillows and things just thrown on the floor. Its like they didn't even clean the room. I paid a couple hundred more and found a much better place for me.... with no childish behavior from the host. Pains me to write this review as a fellow host myself but I would not want anyone else to be fooled into staying here. 
"
21,-7,"Place looked nothing like what is portrayed in the picture. It was basically like a government owned social housing scheme in a very ruined down area. Along with this it was extremely dirty and had no privacy as the door cannot be locked and is in fact just a plank of wood and there was a girl living in the other bedroom in the flat. The toilet was like something you would see in a prison cell and the kitchen area consisted of 1 cupboard and a sink .

Myself and boyfriend didn't stay one night and had to find a hostel in Boston city. When we said it to the landlord he didn't seem to be bothered and just denied that the property had any faults and didn't offer any kind of compensation.

I wouldn't advise any person to take up this accommodation as you will be highly disgusted. I also have pictures of what the accommodation actually looks like if you would like to see them just contact me."
22,-1,"Ich kann mich den vorherigen Bewertungen nur anschließen. Lisa war eine hervorragende Gastgeberin, meine späte Ankunft überhaupt kein Problem, ich wurde willkommen geheißen und noch durch die Wohnung geführt, auf dem Zimmer warteten dann warme Cookies und Snacks. Für meinen Aufenthalt in Boston hatte sie viele hilfreiche Tipps für mich und hat bei Bedarf auch mit Kartenmaterial ausgeholfen. Als ich spontan Besuch durch einen Freund erhielt und Lisa davon erzählt hatte, stand abends, ohne dass es explizit abgesprochen war, ein Feldbett vor meinem Zimmer. Ich habe mich während meines Aufenthalts rundum versorgt gefühlt, wenn etwas fehlte, konnte ich Lisa immer schnell erreichen und Probleme beheben, bevor sie wirklich aufkamen. Das Zimmer entsprach der Beschreibung, die gesamte Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und kann von den Gästen auf zwei Etagen mitgenutzt werden. Ich kann einen Aufenthalt bei Lisa und Brian wärmstens empfehlen und würde jederzeit wieder dort buchen, wenn es mich erneut nach Boston verschlägt."
23,-1,"Lisa est une hôte bienveillante et tout est prêt pour que votre séjour se passe bien. J'ai eu des soucis de transports et Lisa m'a gentiment attendue. Bien qu'en-dehors du centre-ville, le logement est facilement accessible en transports en commun et il y a quelques commerces où faire quelques courses si nécessaire. "
24,-2,Très bien accueillie. Lisa fait tout son possible pour que le séjour soit agréable. Autobus en face et passe de métro un plus. 
25,-1,"Ma sœur et moi avons été bien accueillies par Lisa. Elle nous a fait faire le tour de nos chambres et des endroits communs. Tout a été fait en fonction pour que le séjour des voyageurs soit agréable. (Guide des règles de la maison, Lisa disponible en tout temps pour via message texte pour des questions ou des directions, air climatisé, déjeuners fournies, draps pour le lit et produits pour la salle de bain fournis etc.) Un gros plus : la Charlie card pour le transport en commun qui est fournie avec la location de la chambre est vraiment pratique et très appréciée. "
26,-11,"While others have had great experiences with Seamless, ours was unfortunately not a good one.

We booked a different apartment, but were informed the day before move in that the original apartment had a plumbing problem so we were moved into this one. But that was only after I called to ask why we didn't have move in instructions yet (I'd sent 3 emails asking where the move in instructions were with no reply).  

This apartment had had a long term renter in it that moved out the day before we arrived.  Seamless' cleaning crew worked on it all day and when we arrived it appeared clean on the surface, so we moved in.  Once we were in though we started to see just how dirty it was.  Filthy.  Old food stuck in the kitchen, food stuck in the kitchen sink, sticky spots on the floor, dirty furniture, dirty carpet.  On top of being dirty there was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom, one of the bathroom sinks didn't drain, one of the window blinds fell off when we opened it, the carbon monoxide detector chirped constantly, the elevator was broken (making a loud noise) keeping us up at night (they fixed that on day 3 of our stay). We wanted to move, but it was such a pain we decided to live with it.

I emailed Seamless 3 times while we were in the apartment about the filth and the issues with the apartment and never received a reply.  That's 6 total emails to them without a reply.  I would never rent from them again.


"
27,-2,"This apartment had everything we needed and was very clean. We would definitely stay there again. We didn't have any issues with the temperature while we were there, and it was an unusually cold spell, even for Boston."
28,-1,"De verhuurder was erg behulpzaam.  Ook al hebben we elkaar niet onmoet,  heeft ze vooraf en ook tijdens het verblijf snel op praktische vragen gereageerd.  De lokatie is fantastisch,  het appartement zelf gezellig en zeker als je alleen reist, prima van grootte.  Een fijn bed en een fijne douche. Het is er wel vrij donker,  de ramen komen uit op een binnenplaats, maar als je er overdag toch niet veel bent is dat natuurlijk geen probleem. "
29,-2,"Great location in Back Bay.  Bit tricky to get the key lock open as we arrived in the night and it is difficult to see the numbers.  Make sure you have a light of some sort to help you.  Very close to main shopping areas and bars/restaurants.
Appt itself is well equipped.  There are a few things that are annoying about the place but Jason responded to our issues very quickly  and has promised to look into them.  The main issue is the noise from other apartments ( this appt is the basement floor with other appts above it) , we think when using the shower.  This noise woke us up each day between 4 & 5 am, and we are not light sleepers at all, but this did disturb our rest. 
Overall we had a good time, and assuming that the issues we raised are resolved, we would return and recommend you to stay in this apartment."
30,-1,"Kartik est un hôte en or!!
Tout était parfait pour ma première expérience airbnb.
Kartik a facilité le check-in.
Dans la chambre il y avait des échantillons de shampooing, serviettes etc...
Il m'a aussi proposé du café pour le petit déjeuner .. C'etait parfait!
Merci encore Kartik!"
31,-6,"Very disappointed doesn't begin to explain how we felt about this trip. Booked for 3 nights and left after 1 (wouldn't have stayed one night if we had somewhere else to go). Dirty grubby apartment with single AC in one bedroom so rest of apartment was boiling, broken TV Screen, kitchen smelt of Gas, broken closet door, cracked tiles in bathroom that smelt damp, filthy stairs carpet, and dirty paint work.

Manged to get part of our money back (less than 50%)for canceled nights but only after several phone calls. Host was more interested in Airbnb cancelling booking so he could re let it rather than resolving our issues.

I have the pictures and would of posted them on my review but cant upload them despite the AirBnB review pages saying you can upload them. Not impressed
"
32,-2,"Good description provided to locate and access apartment. Was indeed close to airport as advertised, this was important to us. Besides that we were disappointed. Found it difficult to find a car park close to apartment. One air conditioner in main bedroom meant rest of apartment was quite hot. Floors were not level which was a bit disconcerting as was the weak gas smell in the kitchen. TV had a big crack through the screen. Thought about moving out after first night as it was not satisfactory for my family with three young children."
33,-2,"We were very disappointed. On the pictures the apartmend looked very nice, but it was dirty, especially in the bathroom an the plankets. There was an aggravating smell in the flat and especially in the staircase. The wardrobes were broken and also the skirting boards.
But Jordan was friendly and accessible at any time."
34,-1,"The apartment was very clean, all was like the description said, the apartment has a comple stuff... the only problem is that the internet connection some times is very slow and there was a leak in the bathroom."
35,-3,"The studio was in the basement and it was not bad.  Limited sunlight due to it being in the basement. There was a small, worn loveseat and a small tv.  Small makeshift kitchenette area with coffee. There are somewhat steep stairs down so keep that in mind.  It was sufficient for our needs for one night. "
36,-1,"Our host was a nice person, just beware its a basement and is prone to the issues a basement can have."
37,-1,"Sara was a very welcoming host and provided a tour of the space upon our arrival. This place is great if you are on a budget, but not the most comfortable during the summer since there is no AC. Like others had mentioned, there noticeable smell upon entering the apartment, probably due to the lack of ventilation in the space. A fan was provided, but it was an old fan that was so loud, that it was impossible to watch netflix and have the fan on at the same time. Additionally, the  roku to play netflix was an old system, so you can't even watch with subtitles on."
38,-3,"This host is very organized and accommodating. She walked us through her book of things to do and went out of her way to meet us at the door even when our flight was delayed late into the night.  The room is in the basement and unfortunately, does smell a bit of cat pee. Once the window is open, it helps air flow. "
39,-2,"Pros:
1. Well located - a few stops from downtown and attractions in Boston
2. Sara is well prepared and the room has everything you need

Cons:
1. Room smells of moisture very badly and we had to buy air freshner to be able to stay there
2. There were flies in the room, i killed 3
3. The room was tidy but thrre was dust on the furniture
4. The shower had very low water pressure"
40,-2,"Despite the good location and the attractions and facilities offered by Sara our arrival, my assessment is negative given that there is a strong urine smell of cat, in the room, impossible to remove and which makes the stay very unpleasant (reading other reviews it seems coming from far away not to take solutions)Definitely it would not repeat the stay"
41,-1,"PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ANY AIR BNB ACCOMMODATION! DON'T go off the star rating and just read the first couple of pages of the reviews. Sarah's place was one of the first airBnB accommodations we had booked for our USA travel trip . Sarah was very lovely but unfortunately her place was not and it definitely wasn't up to airBNB standards based on the other accommodation we have now stayed at (some places were cheaper and at a 5 star level) There is a constant smell that I can only describe as cat urine or a dirty cat litter tray... and one window with a note asking you not to open it.. Thinking I dropped something, I glanced under the bed to discover a pile of dust which explained our allergies playing up...there was also an incredible amount of dust on the fan provided. It is very close to public transport which will get you everywhere you need to go easily and is only a short trip from the airport. Sarah has a file of great places to visit in Boston, has a washer and dryer which was also very convenient. If the above wouldn't bother you then I say book this accommodation...otherwise please look else where because the price she charges is not worth it. I hope Sara reads this and rectifies the issues I've posted because it ruined an otherwise perfect air BnB. "
42,-1,"Sara was really helpful re my arrival & also letting me leave my luggage til early afternoon as it meant I could do more tourist visits on my last morning. Access to the Subway was great - close, & quick into the City. The main entrance is not very nice, and once inside the building, the studio is down some narrow steep stairs which could be difficult for big cases or anyone a bit unsteady on their feet. As it's a basement it's dark. It was a hot spell during my visit & the air conditioner was helpful"
43,-1,"The apartment is very close to an mbta station, which makes it easy to reach downtown Boston quickly. The apartment itself is clean and equipped with everything you might need. It is below ground and has only a very small window that cannot be opened. As other visitors already commented, there is an unpleasant odor that was present during our entire stay. In case you're looking for the ""airbnb experience"" in the sense of interaction with the host, you might be disappointed: we met Sara only for check-in and check-out."
44,-9,"Unfortunately, I was far from being satisfied with my stay at Sara’s place, below is a detailed explanation why I feel that way. 
I arrived at Boston for a one-night stay after a transatlantic flight on my way to another destination. Although I came early in the morning (9:00am) Sara allowed me to check-in and made things easy. Sadly, in a later correspondence with her I found out that  “gesture” won't be possible anymore because (quoting from our email correspondence): ""In the future I am going to make my 2pm check-in time firm, and won't allow early bag drop-off, as it has become too much of an inconvenience to cater to the needs of every traveler's individual schedule"".
 All through the night I heard loud noises from the ceiling above me (be aware that the unit is simply her basement floor), of what seemed to be animals running back and forth. The fact that the noises might have been rates, made my sleeping uncomfortable. Retrospectively, I understood that a dog and a cat were the cause for the noises during the night – a fact that was not mentioned in her original airbnb posting.  For those of who consider rent this place – take into consideration the fact that this apartment is a basement above which two very active pets live. If you are allergic to animals, or if you simply don’t want to hear animals running on the floor above you, simply know that it’s a risk you’re gonna take if you’ll stay there.  
The description of the apartment is misleading: ""enjoy beautiful skyline views from across the harbor"". That is simply far from being true. That view is probably possible from the roof of the building, not from the windowless basement! 
Lastly, alas the least disappointing of all, is the fact that the pathway with the stairs leading to the basement were very narrow which made it very difficult to transfer my luggage through. 
Given the above, it is obvious that if I would have known it’ll be such a disaster, I would have paid more and stated somewhere else. 
After my visit, I email Sara expressing my concerns about the noises; her reply was rude and inconsiderate. To my surprise, instead of showing solidary and understanding, her response culminated in “most city apartments have pets” and “maybe next time you should just go to an hotel”. This is not what I would expect from ANY host. 
All in all, if you still reading that feedback, here is what you need to take from it -if you’re interested in a windowless basement unit with a super narrow staircase, with pets running above your head, and with a host that does not care about your feedback – this is your place!!

45,-1,"L'appartement est conforme à la description et est très bien situé. 5 minutes à pied du métro, 3 stations pour rejoindre downtown et tout proche de l'aéroport pour ceux qui arrivent ou repartent en avion. Il est très bien équipé et Sara est disponible. Elle répond rapidement aux questions, et nous a chaleureusement accueilli. Un très bon plan sur Boston, ville si chère en qualité de logement !"
46,-1,Waited up for my arrival -  since my plane was delayed and I didn't get in until the wee hours of the morning. Great crash pad near the airport.  I was able to walk to the to airport car rental facility the following day - saving me a night's rental. 
47,-1,"The location is great for sight-seeing, it's close to downtown and many historical sights. The building looks run down but the apartment itself has been renovated. It is nothing special but everything works. Wi-fi access was fast. Downsides: the restroom was quite small, the toilet seat was too close to the wall to the point it's uncomfortable, the exhaust fan was very loud."
48,-4,"Communication with host was good. It should be noted he is not the owner. It was downhill from there...

Apartment was terrible especially for the price they are asking. Entrance to building was filthy and there was construction debris scattered everywhere. Garbage in the hallway outside the apartment. Inside the apartment was a slight (and I mean slight) improvement. Bathroom was from the 1940's and shower had mould in it. There is drywall cut out throughout it in various spots, exposed electric panel (drywall cutout around it) - odd you don't see the drywall cutouts in the photos??!! I raised all of this with the host and got various excuses/reasons why for all of this. 

I stayed in it for 2 nights and had to leave. I asked for my money back and got nowhere. I realize Boston is an expensive city, but stay elsewhere. for $1100 USD I was HUGELY disappointed. "
49,-1,"Le logement était bien situé. 
Par contre, nous l'avons trouvé sale, il y avait des restes de nourritures sous le lit, la salle de bain était sale, et les draps n'avaient vraisemblablement pas été changés...
Nous n'avons pas vu Ahmed, il nous a envoyé son assistant venu en coup de vent à notre arrivée pour nous remettre les clés. Nous n'avons vu personne à notre départ et avons laissé les clés où nous pouvions !"
50,-3,"NEGATIVES.
1) I never met Ahmed, only Eddie, his friend...
2)Ahmed is very precautions,  no calls, no sms, no (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).. weird and lots of drama.
3)The apartment is smaller what I was thinking about. expensive because the buiding is really in bad conditions.
4) Every morning waking up at 8 am, workers making noisies fixing the building. It was compulsory and I demanded as a priority DO NOT BE DISTURBED, and next day I checked in, he said they will be fixing the building.
5) After checking in I didn't have any contact with Ahmed, I was complaining about the noise and I texted Eddie, and he said he doesn't work with that ) that Ahmed is the one dealing with reservations trying to find if he can find another apartment. Ahmed said no, and I didn't like his way just asking for me to explain and he was giving me silly reasons saying that the noisies from the apartment above probably they took the carpet out and that's why I hear the woman walking.
6) 2 floors by stairs, Forget it if u have big suitcase like me! No elevator because building is very old.
7) The bathroom need renovation URGENTLY, decoration from 30 s.

POSITIVES.
1) Hot water in shower and restroom in just seconds.
2) Location is very central.
3) Eddie brought an iron as I requested.
4) Eddie is very sympa."
51,-2,"All the good reviews are true and the apt is just as pictured, but unfortunately the review about construction noise is also true, at least currently (Dec 2015). 
Good news is future renters will have brand new windows, bad news is I was the one woken at 7:30 am and told to leave the apt because they were putting them in, followed by ungodly noise as they broke the windows across the airshaft so I couldn't just refuse and go back to sleep. 
With a noon checkout I think it's reasonable to expect to sleep till 10, but if you need to I'd suggest waiting till Feb 2016 or so before trying this building (though I bet he can charge more once the work is finished). If you're an early riser this is not a problem, and otherwise the price and location can't be beat."
52,-1,"Anthony a été très disponible pour moi. Sa famille a été très accueillante. La chambre était propre, rien à dire !"
53,-1,"The room was as described. It was very loud because of the Highway directly in front of the house. The T-Station was in 2 minute Walk distance. Anthony organized everything perfectly for us, but we did not meet him face2face. The communication with his family members was hard, they dont speak english. "
54,-1,it is very noisy but OK
55,-1,"The room is very bright and it is only two steps to the train that brings you downtown Boston! For that I recommend it to those who want to get easily to the city because it's not far at all! 
I was there with my boyfriend just for one night but honestly if we had booked for more nights I would have rather spent the double of the price and booked a hotel room... the bathroom was very dirty, hairs all over the floor and we wouldn't have managed to have a shower there if we weren't together! We didn't want to touch anything indide the bathroom! And since there it lives a family we didn't feel comfortable to use the kitchen and other spaces in common....
Anyway the room was clean, but since it is beside a high traffic road and the train it is noisy as hell! We were tired, that's why we had no problem to sleep!"
56,-10,"We stayed at Anthony’s place for 4 nights. It was our first Airbnb experience and after that, maybe our last.

We actually never met Anthony but only had contact with his family (as least we thing it was his family). She could barely speak english and we had a really hard time communicating. 

When we arrived we found hairs in the bed. There was no flat sheet, only a fitted sheet. We had to sleep with the duvet cover in direct contact. They were no other blankets and the room gets really cold as it it drafty. There was a bad smell in all of the appartement.


The worst part; The bathroom. It was smelly moldy and overall dirty. There was hair on the floor and the sink. The walls were covered in dirt and leftover glue from message that were glued on the walls. All hand towels were wet and smelly so we had nothing to dry our hands after washing them. The bathtub was moldy and very dirty. There is no fan in the bathroom and the window was always left closed so it smelled bad. We always felt dirtier after leaving the bathroom. The sink counter was always covered in water that was droping on the floor. The bath mat was always soaking wet. Towels were not provided. The timeframe to use the bathroom was also impossible. Since we couldn’t communicate with the family, we never knew when it was ok to take showers or even go to the bathroom. There was only one bathroom for everybody so it was almost always in use. When it wasn’t, it was even dirtier than before. Each morning, after the family used the bathroom, the lady would use the bathroom sink to clean and rinse her mop, there was brown dirt water and hair everywhere. Only after that we could use the bathroom and by then, it was almost 9;00. We tried to take our showers at night but the bathroom was also always in use. 

We were also supposed to have acces to the kitchen but it was so dirty  (food from the night before still on the table, plastic bags full of stuff on the counters) and there wasn’t any space for us. We only wanted to put a take out box in the fridge and there weren’t any space.   The pictures that you can see on the page are clearly of before they moved into the appartement

The pictures are also not of the present bedroom used. Furniture is not all the same. 

We would not go back. The price of the room is high for such a bad experience. It is also very noisy, even with earplugs we could ear the Highway.
"
57,-1,"this was falsely advertised, and arguably the worst place i have ever stay. ever. 

pictures are not accurate. 

the kitchen is so disgusting that the only thing we, very cautiously, used was the toaster.
the disgusting kitchen causes the entire apartment to smell bad.

bedroom is 'clean enough'.

did not meet anthony, but he seemed nice via text, email, etc."
58,-2,It was really cold outside when I was in Boston. And Anthony's place don't have central heating but there is one radiator working in the room. The windows were sealed by plastic film but you can still feel a little wind blowing in. I thought it would be cold that night but I didn't feel anything after falling into sleep. Maybe it is because I was too tired. The house is just one minute walking to metro station. Really convenient. It is not a bad experience anyway. 
59,-6,"I have used airbnb for almost 3 years, either by my own account or my sister's account, and I have to say this was my worst experience ever. I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience. 
In addition, the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle, and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.
Again, I never want to post a negative comment, but this was just too much for me. I guess the only cons is that parking is easily available, and maybe a relatively low price. But still, I think for that price I can get a better place where I can at least sleep peacefully at night.
Lastly, Anthony was easy to contact with, he replied me instantly."
60,-1,"Great location and clean room.. there is a bar and breakfast nearby!But near the metro and the road which is t(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) noise ,and the radiator occasionally with a loud hissing noise... "
61,-1,It is very convenient to go to the downtown. The only problem is that it is noisy outside at night.
62,-1,"The room is sunny and there is a separate fridge. As a whole, this one is larger and better than the other one in the apartment. However, it's a little bit noisy. Washing machine and fridge in the kitchen cannot be used and there is not very much communication between host and me. The host didn't answer some of the questions I asked, which makes me a little bit disappointed. Also, breakfast is not provided as the description. Anyway, it's close to subway station."
63,-1,"Sami est très sympa et nous a bien accueilli, même si nous étions trop fatigués le soir pour rester discuter on à particulièrement bien dormi (en fait ça faisait longtemps qu'on a pas aussi bien dormi). L'appartement est très propre et bien rangé la salle de bain est grande et tout comme le reste de l'appartement elle est très propre.

Merci Sami pour cet accueil et à bientôt j'espère."
64,-3,"Small but nice apartment. Check-in went very easy (I was e-mailed the access codes a couple of days before our arrival) and we were allowed to leave our luggage in the building after check-out, which was a big plus. Close to public transport (bus stops across the street and two metro lines are a 5-minute walk). Bars/restaurants downstairs and a lot more up Tremont street (10-minute walk). Only big downside: the noise. The apartment is on a big intersection and it appears that nothing is done to cancel out the noise from outside. I was able to fall asleep with earplugs and the traffic noise dies down late at night but we weren't able to sleep later than 7AM due to traffic and construction noise. It didn't ruin our stay but I wouldn't have chosen the apartment if I had known."
65,-1,"Booked with Will for my family's trip to Boston - they're pretty picky and they had no major complaints.  They said everything was great, except the bed was a little saggy.  Overall, great experience - Will's communications were very informative and my family had a great time.  Thanks Will!"
66,-1,"Al contrario di altri Host, con Will ci siamo sentiti solo tramite messaggio, però devo dire che stato sempre molto disponibile e rispondeva quasi subito. Ci ha inviato i codici per accedere alla porta principale e dell'appartamento. Appartamento accogliente e pulito e con tutto il necessario. L'unica pecca e che essendo al 3 piano quando arrivi con le valigie si fa fatica a salire avendo scale ripide. Comodo alla metro e per chi vuole anche a piedi ci vogliono 15 min per il centro. Supermercato e ristoranti vicini. Ci siamo trovati bene!! Grazie

Nous avons donc du tambouriner à la porte de la maison pendant 15 minutes jusqu'à ce qu'un locataire nous ouvre. Il a appelé plusieurs fois Piter qui était sur messagerie. Au bout d'une demi-heure, il a enfin rappelé pour dire comment trouver la clef !!!

69,-2,"Lana was great. Our flight from London was late so we didn't get to her place until 10:00 pm (we did pre warn her) and it was no problem. 

If you want a place close to the airport, but not disturbed by aircraft noise, Lana's place is well situated.

Unfortunately we had to leave next morning and so could do any exploration of her area, but from the taxi ride, there seem a choice of places to go to. "
70,-1,"HoSt answered all texts in a timely fashion & provided important information.  Small kitchen appliances, filthy; shower curtain liner, moldy; bathroom floor, filthy; one headboard nearly detached from bed; dining table broken; couch , torn; food in fridge very very expired (i.e. soy sauce, 2008). "
71,-2,"This place is in fact a hostel that Carols created in the basement of a house. Then, don't expect staying at Carols' place, and exchanging with her about Boston (we didn't see Carols, just her mother who opened us the door. She wes nevertheless very quick to answer the text messgaes). 
The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were clean. The bedroom was a little bit small, but with a TV (if you're interested in it) and wifi access. 
The main problem is that the ""hostel"" is located in the basement : it's quite dark and there is no windows, and no daylight coming.
We were also a little bit disappointed not to have towels (as it was said in the description).
The other big flaw is the sound-proofing : the walls are thin and we could hear all the converation coming from the neighbouring bedroom. 
The location is quite good : 15 min walk from the red line, then you have a train every 10 minutes and then you reach downtown in 20 min.

72,-1,"La chambre était très propre est bien rangée, avec une armoire, une télé et un bureau, exactement comme sur les photos. Il y a aussi un ventilateur, ce qui est très agréable étant donné qu'il n'y a pas de fenêtre et qu'il peut y faire assez chaud. La salle de bain était assez propre également, ce que j'ai apprécié. Quant à la cuisine, j'étais satisfaite de l'équipement dont je disposais (notamment la vaisselle de base, le grille-pain et le petit four). Par contre, le frigo n'avait pas du tout été nettoyé et les étagères étaient toutes collantes.
Sinon, il était agréable de pouvoir manger dans la cour sur les tables et chaises de jardin.
Globalement, je suis satisfaite de l'accueil de Carols et de sa famille; ils étaient toujours prêts à nous aider si besoin. J'ai aussi aimé le fait que de nombreuses cartes de la ville et du réseau de transport en commun étaient disponibles pour les invités."
73,-1,"Très bon accueil de Cynthia et de Keith, son mari, très chaleureux tous les deux! Le petit déjeuner copieux était très appréciable. Chambre très confortable, petite difficulté, l'accès à la salle de bain/WC avec les 3 chambres occupées, un WC extérieur serait le bienvenu... Pour se rendre au centre ville, il faut compter une heure entre l'attente du bus, le trajet en bus 31, le métro, ligne orange, mais c'est faisable tout de même... Je recommande chaudement l'adresse!
Nicole et Jean"
74,-1,"Das Zimmer war geräumig und wie beschrieben, mit einem bequemen Doppelbett und sogar Fernseher im Zimmer selbst. Badezimmer und Küche werden mit der Familie geteilt, aber alles problemlos und sehr sauber.
Cynthia selbst haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt, dafür hat uns ihre Enkelin sehr freundlich willkommen geheißen. Die Gastgeber waren auch sehr flexibel mit der Ankunftszeit.
Das Zimmer liegt etwas außerhalb von Boston, ist aber mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gut zu erreichen (Bushaltestelle nah beim Haus 10 Minuten Fahrt + 25 Min. mit der U-Bahn; alternativ 12 Min. gehen + 20 Min. Fahrt mit der S-Bahn).
Auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen, haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt!"
75,-2,"Cynthia met us very late to let us in and was very welcoming and accommodating. The house and room was clean and pleasant. Unfortunately we stayed on a Saturday night and the noise from the street was very loud as various neighbors were partying. The Windows are thin and if you are a light sleeper this place might be difficult on a weekend. Also, the walls are thin and you can hear if people are walking around outside the room which is another difficulty for light sleepers. We ended up not getting any sleep because we are both light sleepers and decided to stay somewhere else the next night. A lovely and clean home over all with kind hosts though."
76,-1,"Mon séjour dans l'appartement d'Anne s'est très bien passé. Elle était là pour m'accueillir et me montrer l'appartement, qui est très agréable : spacieux, lumineux, calme, dans un bon immeuble et très bien situé à Boston. De plus, il est tout équipé (pour la cuisine, dans la salle de bain), il n'y a plus qu'à y déposer ses valises et profiter de l'endroit !"
77,-1,"L'appartement est bien situé dans Boston. Ceci étant, il n'est pas aussi agréable que les photos le laissent paraître. De plus, la proximité d'une voie express ne permet pas aisément d'ouvrir les fenêtres lorsqu'il fait chaud, surtout si l'air conditionnée ne marche pas (notons qu'elle ne fonctionne que dans la chambre).
Pour ce qui est des relations avec Paige. Nous pouvons dire que Paige est un hôte qui a su répondre rapidement lorsque nous l'avons contacté pour les dysfonctionnements de l'air conditionné et l'excessive chaleur de l'appartement. En revanche, les notes et consignes laissées dans l'appartement ne sont pas très claires, tout comme le fonctionnement de la clé d'accès. Par chance, ce sont des voisins qui nous ont renseignés et nous ont permis de rentrer chez nous le premier soir !"
78,-1,"Valerie und Jason waren sehr freundlich. Bei der Begrüßung wurde uns alles gezeigt und erklärt. Die Tipps zur Stadt waren auch sehr nützlich. Das Zimmer war genau so wie es die Bilder gezeigt haben. Zudem war das Bad und Zimmer sehr sauber und wir haben alles vorgefunden, was wir gebraucht haben. Das Frühstück war sehr gut und es war schön währenddessen mit den beiden Gastgebern ins Gespräch zu kommen. 
Parken vor der Tür war überhaupt kein Problem.
Die Innenstadt konnten wir problemlos mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln erreichen!"
79,-2,"Unsere Gastgeber waren nett und haben uns mit Wasserflaschen und Ear plugs gegen den Strassenlärm versorgt. Auch haben sie (und ihre Tochter) uns Tipps gegeben, was wir in Boston anschauen sollen und uns eine Extraeintrittskarte, die sie noch hatten, gegeben.

Die Nachbarschaft war sehr dreckig, laut und nachts ""sketchy"". Die Wohnung war allerdings sehr sauber und aufgeräumt. Der U-bahnstopp ist ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuss entfernt. Frühstück war Kaffee, Toast und Marmelade und etwas Selbstgebackenes von Valerie (für uns Bananennussbrot und etwas mit Erdnussbutter, beides sehr gut). Das Internet hat oftmals kaum oder gar nicht funktioniert, vor allem oben im dritten Stock wo das Schlafzimmer ist."
80,-1,"This place was in a beautiful area of Boston. The listing did describe it well, however we were surprised to find out we were staying on the sixth floor and the elevator is quite scary. We unfortunately had terrible neighbors. They ruined our first night there by throwing a college party next door. We contacted Inn Boston and they were helpful with the situation, but due to snow no one could come out. We did get refunded and they cannot control rude guests."
81,-1,"Desde el principio Lev fue un anfitrión muy atento, respondiendo rápidamente a cualquier consulta o reclamación. Hubo un malentendido por nuestra parte cuando elegimos este apartamento, al creer que la capacidad de 6 personas que figura en la información se debía a que aparte de las dos camas dobles de las habitaciones, el sofá que hay en el salón era sofá-cama, lo que era lo que buscábamos porque a pesar de ser solo 4 personas, nuestra hija y nuestro hijo son ya mayores y preferian dormir separados. Al ver cuando llegamos que no era así, le hicimos saber a Lev nuestro malestar, pero él nos dijo que cuando son más de 4 personas tiene una cama hinchable, que nos ofreció inmediatamente sin sobrecoste alguno.
Son de agradecer detalles al recibimiento como fruta, leche o zumo y otros en la nevera (estos últimos a reponer, pero que  hacen más cómoda la llegada) y bombones.
En cuanto al apartamento, lo mejor es la ubicación, a pocos minutos del Common y la flexibilidad en el horario de entrada con el lock-box. Lo peor, la subida de 4 pisos con 4 maletas por la empinada y sucísima escalera, que da una impresión horrible. El apartamento en sí estaba limpio aunque no tanto como se espera de alguien que te pide que dejes tus zapatos fuera, encontrando algunas baldas con polvo acumulado. 
 "
82,-1,"Lev a été très disponible pour que notre séjour se passe très bien. Son appartement est très bien situé et proche de tout ce qu'il faut voir à Boston. Nous avons logé à 5 sans aucun soucis, le matelas pour le  séjour est un vrai matelas gonflable super épais.  Il y avait les fruits, et le nécessaire pour le petit déjeuner.  L'appartement est au 3ème."
83,-1,"Christopher is very responsive, and every question was answered very quickly.  Some of the ""warnings"" that he listed in his welcome letter kind of scared us a bit, but when we got there, there were no nosy neighbors to avoid.  I suspect the warnings were based on his prior experience with guests, but we had nothing to worry about."
84,-1,"Die Suite war wirklich sehr sehr schön und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Dank der shoe-off policy ist es schön sauber. Am besten war das geräumige Bad, das zwei Waschbecken, eine große Dusche und einen Whirlpool zu bieten hat. Die Nachbarschaft ist idyllisch und ruhig, das Haus auch sehr schön. Es gibt noch zwei andere Suiten aber das bekommt man fast nicht mit. Der einzige Minuspunkt war, dass es verboten ist in der großen, toll ausgestatteten Küche zu kochen. Aber nichtsdestotrotz genossen wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr."
85,-1,Very nice unit and it was in brand new condition when we arrived.  Unfortunately the unit can be very noisy with a highway outside the window and construction across the street.
86,-1,"We never meet anyone. Only got email prior to our arrival with the codes to the doors.
We came six together and I got informations that there would be towels and pillows for everyone. That was not true since there were only 5 towels in the apartment.
There are also only 3 small plates and 5 coffee mugs but 6 bigger plates and some glasses.
The sleeper sofa is broken but we found some air mattress to use instead.

At arrival we also noticed that the cleaning had not been that great with something sticky on the counter top and few very dirty glasses in the cabinet.

We could leave our luggage in the apartment until 2pm that was very good for us and I noticed that the cleaning was much better after our stay. We saw that when we got back to the apartment to get the luggage.

Location is good. Not that far distance to Newbury St. 

The washing machine smells really badly.

So to sum it up then it was a OK place to stay because of location but it was not as clean as we would hope for and I am not the ""always"" cleaning type of person but if you would be coming to stay at my apartment I would at least have it clean for you (specially for this price per night)"
87,-2,"This apt is managed by a company so there was no interaction with the host or anyone else. This made check in and check out easy. My only complaint is that the apartment is not in the best shape- it was clean (sanitary sheets and towels) but there were broken glasses in the kitchen cabinet when we arrived, stains on the rugs and walls everywhere, rips in the barstools, etc... These were minor things that did not affect our visit- but the apt seems overpriced for such poor quality furnishings and overall care. Additionally it was cold and we never could figure out how to adjust the temperature with the thermostat. Location however is great and was the main reason for choosing this apt."
88,-1,"Notre hôte est arrivé en retard de 20mn. Ensuite aucun accueil. Il n a pas présenté l appartement. On a du lui demander nous même les clefs. Et ce fut le dernier contact du séjour. Durée de notre échange avec lui à peine 2mn le temps de monter à l appartement.

Salle de bain et cuisine horriblement sale.
Crotte de nez sur le mur de la salle de bain... Des tonnes de poussières. Frigo et gazinière trop sale pour pouvoir les utiliser. Table de la cuisine pas nettoyée.

La chambre : Lit non fait et sans draps adaptés. Le draps house faisait office de drap. Et pas de protège matelas. Des poussières sur le sol.

Loin du métro et du bus. Il faut 15\20mn de marche à pied.

Bref, à éviter 
Prix beaucoup trop élevé "
89,-2,Air condition and wifi were terrible also home was so dirty
90,-2,"Jack was a nice guy and accommodating when I showed up much later than expected. The location is good but the apartment itself is filthy. There were stains on the walls/carpets, mold growing in the bathroom, overwhelming clutter in the bathroom and a very strong lingering odor. I'm not sure if the AC stopped working one night, but my room got so hot I couldn't fall asleep. I guess you get what you pay for. If you can get past these annoyances, it's a great buy!"
91,-1,"Concept d'hébergement séduisant avec appartement moderne, tout confort bien équipé, piscine, salle de sport et barbecue extérieur. Métro à 10 mn à pieds et gare routière à 15mn. Whole food market pour préserver sa santé juste à côté. Supermarché chinois à 100m.  Juste une petite remarque pratique, nous aurions aimé pouvoir déposer les bagages dans un local avant le check-in et après le check-out. Sinon très bonne adresse à recommander."
92,-10,"It advertises that street parking is available however there is  resident only parking and visitor parking is not available till atleast a mile away which also is always full.
As you enter the house, there is a steep staircase which had an extremely foul smelling odor. Once you enter the house, it certainly does not look as expensive or maintained as in pictures. Living room couch is uncomfortable to say the least.
Both bedrooms had very uncomfortable beds with them being warped with both sides slanting thus making it very difficult to sleep.
All airbnbs I have stayed in have always had teas, coffee, small snacks and bread for guests and basic toiletries .This listing lacked all of it. 
For the price point of 300$ a night a lot was expected and among the 4 of us, this was one of the couples first air BNB experience and they are weary of trying it again.
As for neighborhood, it's very shady at night.
I will not be staying again in this listing and would rather do a hotel for this price point."
93,-1,"PROS: 

Place was nearby the ferry where we needed to go and close to downtown and the airport. 

Shawn responds quickly to messages. 

CONS:

It was a hassle trying to get credit back from Shawn from an issue that occurred. I'm a busy person like everyone else and had to reach out to him twice to prompt a credit on his end. 

East coast and West coast usually have no central air, but be aware that there is no fan in the rooms or living rooms. AC unit in back room is loud and I could not sleep. 

No toiletries and coffee.

Clim dans tout l'appartement, pas réglable de manière indépendante, réglé plutôt frais pour des standards européens. Du coup, on dort avec un duvet en plein été, mais pas réellement gênant. Pas possible d'obscurcir complètement la pièce, mais pas un souci pour moi car éveil aux aurores à cause du jet lag. Confort digne d'un hôtel 4 étoiles."

Le quartier est calme, il faut compter 10 min de marche pour aller au métro et 10 min de métro pour se rendre en centre-ville
Le plus: le balcon
Le bémol (s'il faut en trouver un...): la pression de la douche ;)

"
98,-7,"Our AirBnB experience began with a man coming out of the apartment we had paid for and reserved carrying laundry. He was told by Andy that he could use the facilities. This was very off putting . When we came into the apartment we noticed that there were no washcloths. Andy was notified and quickly delivered hand towels the next day. We received one towel (stained and smelly)per person for the duration of our trip (4 days). There is a washer/dryer in the unit but you have to pay to dry your items (bring your own detergent). When we arrived, the dirty towels from a previous tenant were cascading over the washer- disgusting. There is no soap at the sinks in the kitchen or bathrooms so be prepared to buy your own. Also there is only one roll of toilet paper per bathroom so be forewarned. 

After a quick inventory of the apartment we realized that it was equipped with 3 chairs and a love seat. One of these chairs was broken and was held together with a shoelace. Since this property was advertised as something that accommodated 8 people we were very shocked and disappointed to find that this was not so. In the kitchen there is 1 glass, 4 forks, 5 spoons and 1 knife. Again, this would not even accommodate a group of 4 more or less 8. We traveled as a group of 6 so we were unable to cook/share a meal together or gather together in the living room. 2 people sat on the floor. 

This apartment has no central AC. There are fans in every room and even with the windows open the temperature remained at a balmy 80 degrees. There is very limited parking in front of the apartment. All of the spaces are labeled resident only permit parking and there were no accommodations made for us renting the space. 

The bottom unit is quite noisy when there are tenants above. It is also noisy due to the proximity to the airport. Bring ear plugs! "
99,-1,"The apartment we rent is in the half-basement of a three-family house, located in a not-so-good, difficult-to-find neighborhood, which nonetheless is convenient to the airport and subway (walking distance of 10 minutes). 

There is a nice backyard with sloping woods extending downhill. 

The apartment is in clean but spartan condition. There are four very simple bedrooms and three dorm-style bathrooms, which will accommodate up to eight people. But the kitchen is large enough to hold 2-3 people at most with a small table that seats 2. There is also the infamous chair whose leg is held by a shoe-lace. 

The Wifi signal is weak and there is little or no signal in some of the rooms. Thanks to the basement location, it is difficult to receive carrier signal as well. 

The attached laundry room is dirty and littered with dirty linens, making it difficult to use the coin-operated washer and dryer. 

What makes it worst is the lack of A/C units. It did not help that our visit coincided with some of the hottest days in Boston, when mid-day temperature reached 103. We had four big floor fans inside, but they were as loud as the propeller of the piston-engine planes. 

But then there is value: the $288/day rate translates to $41 per person, or less than $40 if rented by a gang of eight. If you are traveling on a tight budget, then this may not be a bad choice."
100,-5,"The house was not exactly what we expected to be. For some things different from the description.

Strenght:

-impossible cooking: just one dirty pot in the kitchen

The apartment was very cozy and in a great location, near everything. The only issues I had were noise and an uncomfortable sleep. Being right near the metro, make sure you like the ""city"" noises. My daughter had no issue with the noise level, but being a suburbanite, it made it difficult for me to sleep. Also, unfortunately, we were completely unable to sleep on the futon. That is the only reason I took one star away.  We could feel every bar and bump in it. I woke every time I tried to shift, and my daughter wasn't able to get any sleep at all. If the hosts replace the futon, it will be a perfect room for the right person. "

We actually did not even end up staying in the room listed so can't speak to the cleanliness/coziness or anything regarding that. However, overall the entire experience was somewhat miserable. We were delayed on getting to the place due to a winter storm in Boston, arrived at the place which was on a poorly shoveled street. We could not find the key he had left for us and because we were already short on time, we left for an event we had planned with all our luggage. After the event, we learned that the MBTA would be closed the following day due to the snow emergency and we communicated to the host that we would not be able to stay that night due to the closing of the public transportation, effectively getting us stuck in Boston. To my surprise he was inconsiderate and non accommodating. Sean seemed like a nice guy from the reviews, and that is why I booked this place to begin with. However this was not the case at all. Sean did not offer to accommodate us in this predicament, instead, he started to blame us for poor planning, threatening to not refund his portion of the room, which we found ridiculous since we did not even stay there. Bottom line is Sean could have been a little more understanding in this particular situation. Based on my experience I personally would not recommend any of my friends/family booking with this host, as he did not ""host"" us well in my opinion and did not make our Valentine's Day snow troubles any simpler.   

On a good note I applaud Airbnb customer service who actually understood our situation and were able to resolve the issue very quickly. "
106,-1,"The location is great, at the heart of Beacon Hill. We didn't see our host but he gave good indications to get the keys and was helpful on the phone when we wanted extra information. We had a bad surprise upon arrival of being given the wrong room, but this was quickly fixed before the first night. That said, the place is really shabby. The shower works properly but the bathtub has a really dreadful appearance and the fridge makes a terrible noise during the night. More generally, staying in the apartment was unpleasant. I would only recommend it if you're looking for a bed with a roof and four walls in Boston - which is a shame given that it's in Beacon Hill. But for travelling as a couple in a leisure trip, this was definitely not what we had hoped for."
107,-4,"This is my fifth time using Airbnb. I've had three winners and two losers. This on falls in the latter category. First I'll list the good things. The location was great. Close to the T & just a few blocks from the Commons & anything else you'd want to see in Boston. The price was good & the water was hot. 

Now the bad. The place is filthy. There is so much dirt on the blades of the ceiling fan you could plant a garden. The lone chair is grotesquely stained. We refused to shower because of the deplorable condition of the tub. The place is small, so a minimal amount of effort to actually dust & mop would go a long way. But as it is, I would not recommend anyone stay here. "
108,-2,"Le logement occupé (qui ne correspndait pas à celui annoncé mais à proximité immédiate) est très bien situé (cœur de ville, proche de tout les essentiels, y compris transports en commun) et parfaitement bien équipé. Il s'agit d'un studio avec trois vrais couchage (pas de matelas pneumatique pour faire le 3ème). Le tout est ancien, mériterait sans aucun doute un bon rafraichissement, particulièrement la salle de bain (les photos sont trompeuses) et la propreté laisse un peu à désirer (il suffit de se pencher sous le lit pour s'en apercevoir). Sean, que nous n'avons pas vu durant notre séjour, est un hôte arrangeant (check out à 3PM). Les clefs sont récupérés et déposées dans une boite à combinaison dans la rue). Aucun problème majeur ou insurmontable, nous y reviendrions sans aucune retenue."
109,-1,"Sean was a very responsive host. He answered our questions and gave very straightforward directions to getting the key, finding the apartment, and getting around the city via public transportation. We arrived earlier than the check in time and Sean cleaned the previous guest's mess when we headed out to explore the city. 
However, we were disappointed with our experience in this apartment. Our other reason for booking with this place was to see the unique interior advertised in the listing, but once we arrived, it looked like the apartment was in the process of repainting. Since it the place seemed incomplete, the apartment looked like it was in a poor state of disrepair. The windows in the bathroom had a quarter inch gap that made the bathroom very cold. The toilet needs to be bolted down and the shower curtains were held by a piece of string. At one point during our stay we had to scrub the bathtub because we thought it was still dirty. 
The price was great, but there are more comfortable places in the area."
110,-2,"It was close to where we wanted to be: near the beginning of the freedom trail and cute shops/restaurants. It was also close to the public transit in case we needed it, but we mostly walked around and ubered. The key was easy to access and we didn't have trouble, but the way it was described made me skeptical. The biggest thing that bothered me, throughout the two nights I stayed there, was the faucet kept leaking and it was the most annoying thing in the world. I tried to get it to stop by softening the fall with a sponge, but it could not be avoided. It's an easy fix though and I hope it's done next time I go there, because I would love to stay again."
111,-1,Extremely well located but poorly maintained and dirty... 
112,-1,"The room is smaller  than I expected. Two guests are just fine but three guests would be very narrowed. Even though the check in time is 12 o'clock, but the host's cleaning time is 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. And it's hard to contact the host. I stayed in Sean's house for two days. The first day I just wanted to ask him if we could check in a little earlier, he didn't answered any of my calls or texts. And in the first night, we found the wifi has problem and I  texted him and he said he would check it next morning, however it was still no wifi next day and he didn't reply me any more! Finally I got his text after we checked out, he said ""100 percent wifi uptime is not guaranteed""!"
113,-3,"We loved the neighborhood and picked Sean's place because it was steps away from my old apartment I lived in during my 20s- a nostalgia trip. We did meet Sean who seemed very nice. We gave a low rating because this is a marginally maintained building and studio. We were disappointed in the shabby condition of the interior building entry, filthy carpets- rundown feel. It happens I know on Beacon Hill with old places. The studio one room is the size it appears in the photo but is not accurate to the photo. The bathroom has a terrible looking tub and the sink is very old pedestal and pink and not the one shown on the site photo. There is no longer natural pine panelling, but is painted orange flat paint. Floors are wood but badly scratched. Roller shades are tenement style ugly and taped with duct tape. Windows are so, so needing to be cleaned and could easily be windexed from the street since the apt is street level. Very skimpy dishes/glasses. Couldn't find one drinking glass but maybe we missed that.
Pros are that it is quiet, it was relatively clean on surfaces, hot shower, very comfy bed- wonderful mattress. And of course loved the location.
There is no TV but they never said there was so that's ok. We didn't think about that and missed the Olympics at night but went to a bar to watch. "
114,-2,"I'll start with the pros:
The neighborhood is great. Most of the people on the street are nice and say hello. Also, there is an African food market right down the street that sales inexpensive fish and groceries.

The host is a nice person at heart.

The cons:
The room is very far away from town.

Public transportation ranges from perfect to spotty- one time I had to get an Uber home because the buses were delayed over an hour. The residence is far enough away from the city for walking to be impractical.

Although nice, the host does not seem to understand how to operate a business of this nature.

The host charged $40 for an extra person but did not offer an additional mattress or key until asked. This usually would not be an issue; however, the host made me and my roomate take a bed up a very narrow flight of stairs and I had to assemble the frame. This was doable for two young men, but was not easy. The key had to be made, which means that one of us went without a key for a day.

The host left town and expected me to leave the city to let in another guest. The host called and texted me numerous times during a professional meeting, despite me telling her that I would not be able to let the guest in. This was very distracting and disrespectful for me and the person that was waiting to get in.

The other guest waited at her doorstep for several hours and ended up sleeping at a random neighbor's house the first night- this could be you. 

In addition, the host sent me a picture of the other guest's passport for some reason- I guess so I could verify who he was. However, this is grossly inappropriate and makes me extremely uncomfortable knowing she has a picture of my ID."

116,-3,The place's quality is average for this price point. But we had a hard time sleeping in the room due to the loud noise of the in-room refrigerator and light coming through a thin window curtain.
117,-3,The accommodation was dirty and unacceptable. The refrigerator was so smelly we could not use it. There was mildew in shower curtain.

121,-1,"The area where the boat is docked is not what we thought of as 'up and coming' - it is totally isolated and not walkable to anything interesting. The water taxi is the only way to get around and the schedule we were given was not accurate and made it very confusing to use. The boat itself had mold in the ceilings, bugs in the toilet and a small kitchen that is difficult to actually use because of the electrical outlets. We had many other complaints that space does not permit listing. This was like a camping experience and overall not worth the price. We feel it was misrepresented on the the website."
122,-3,A very unique experience with some unfortunate issues that could not get worked out. Thought we could have a fun non-hotel experience while on a business trip. Hot water was only available for 1 out of 4 days and this was very uncomfortable given that I was with clients all week. Ryan sent over a manager each day that was unable to fix the problem.
123,-3,"Neighborhood wasn't bad but apartment was dingy and dark. Not worth the money.  Parking was not included as indicated in the listing and had to haggle over the parking. He wanted to charge $30 a night for parking. Upon checking in, keys were wet and sticky with who knows what. Apartment not kept up with. Light bulbs out everywhere, dirty floors, not very clean overall. Would rather spend a little bit more money and stay in a hotel. Worst air Bnb I've stayed in for the price. "
124,-1,"The place was clean and usable for sleeping purposes. There just was not too much you can do in there. Also, apparently the floors seem to have been an issue as the residents downstairs were complaining about loud foot steps at night."
125,-7,"It was the worst experience ever, the first thing we encountered entering was an overwhelming smell of dog and cat filth , and on the left side of the front door was a fish tank that hadn't been  cleaned for a long time , so smell combined together was stinky fish mix with dog and cat filth , there were also banana skin and dust everywhere,the bathrooms were also filthy and which she only proceeded to clean after we had complained about the deplorable state they were in. I have known people that kept pet's in their homes but I never had to take that kind of stench these people/host\zoo keepers had better get their act together before word gets out and the health department is summoned to pay them a visit .I can go on and on about my unfortunate and unhealthy experience but I have other things to take care of at this time , I do still have 1 question in the back of my mind who are these people that gave such good reviews about this place we're they paid to do that or are they family members doing a favor lol either way people beware of these inconsiderate people that are only interested in getting your money without having the decency to at least reciprocate with comfortable accommodations for the paying customer . Have a wonderful day everyone ."
126,-1,We had a very pleasant stay at Shawn's. We had no problem checking in and out. Our hosts were kind enough to provide maps and directions to the nearest subway station. Also unlike other guests we did not have any noise issues at night. 
127,-2,"The space was itself was very comfortable but there were a few disappointments that I need to flag. 

Upon our arrival, neither Ari nor Marika was there to greet us -- not the end of the world, but a little bizarre being greeted by a (seemingly)  empty house. 

Most notably, the lock to the room was broken despite  my specific request for confirmation that it worked beforeI booked the space. 

While Ari had extenuating circumstances that made it impossible for me to get in touch with him, Marika -- the point of contact that Ari provided -- was also inaccessible until many hours later. That said, my boyfriend and I spent two hours jimmying the lock shut. 

Unfortunately, we didn't feel safe the rest of the trip -- the lack of any concrete contact was unsettling and no locksmith ever came to fix the door, despite Marika's guarantee the situation would rectified.

As mentioned, the space itself was great but really wish we weren't so mislead about the lock situation. "

129,-4,No where on the AirBNB description does it say that this is across the street from a landfill and prison. My girlfriend was afraid to even enter the apartment. We had to leave early because she was so uncomfortable and felt so unsafe. 
130,-1,"We had some confusion at first with checking in, but once we got that straightened out, everything else was fine.  This is a working class neighborhood with limited parking, unless you have a resident permit."
131,-1,"The apartment was filthy upon arrival and pictures on website were not indicative of what we saw. Only 1 towel in bathroom for 2 people. We had to borrow towels, etc. from family nearby, due to lack of basic amenities. Host was difficult to communicate with in a timely fashion and made no effort to resolve issues during our stay, but did receive partial refund after several requests. Family member even had to go to hosts' jobsite to  get keys after several texts. Would never recommend."
132,-2,"Victoria und Tim bewohnen ein sehr schönes Häuschen im Viktorianische Stil; Im Untergeschoss befindet sich quasi eine zweite Wohnung mit zwei Zimmern, Küche und Bad. Ich habe während meines Aufenthalts das kleinere der beiden Zimmer bewohnt. Die Kommunikation im Vorhinein lief ganz einfach über Airbnb. Tim, Victorias Mann, hat mich freundlich empfangen und mir alles gezeigt. In der Wohnung hat man alles was man so braucht. Wenn es an irgendwas fehlt, fragt Victoria. Die Kommunikation lief dann auch meist über Airbnb; die beiden haben einen kleinen Sohn und da will man nicht ständig klingeln. 
Die Nachbarschaft, Dorchester, ist ein netter kleiner Vorort mit vielen Viktorianischen Häusern. Die Leute sind alle ziemlich freundlich und man kommt leicht ins Gespräch. Nach Downtown Boston kommt man innerhalb von 20-30 Minuten mit der Red Line (fährt auch bis Harvard). die Busverbindungen sind auch gut. Man kann aber auch mal einen Tag in Dorchester verbringen; die Straße runter gibt es einen Basketballplatz, Baseball- und Footballfeld; es gibt ein paar kleine Läden; einen netten Pub mit gutem Bier; einen fantastischen Vietnamesen; und eine Haltestation Richtung Downtown eine Bucht mit Strandabschnitt.
Aber seht selbst. Victorias Häuschen ist auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert ;)"
133,-1,"Good location. Very, very small room. Only accesible by steep stairs 3rd floor (As advertised) It gets very hot in the summer in spite of the AC unit. ( window cannot be open to get natural airflow) Internet is shared across all building so speed is ver variable. Very limited cable TV offering. Little flexibility on check in/ check out ( fees for everything). No hair dryer. "
134,-3,"The apartment was located in the basement and it was very dark. It was a small studio with a tiny kitchenette. It was exactly 1 mile away from the prudential center (I (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)d it) and at least a 20-minute walk, not 7 minutes as claimed. Even if you ran, you would hardly be able to make it in 7 minutes. 

In terms of facilities, the wi-fi was very slow and with the apartment being in the basement, the connection was choppy and my devices often disconnected or couldn't connect to the router. The washer and dryer cost $2 EACH, plus the dryer doesn't even work properly!! My clothes would come out wet and the dryer was only half full.

In terms of dealing with the host, he made me sign a lease, which basically says I won't stay past the dates listed on the airbnb. I wouldn't have stayed in the tiny, dark apartment any longer than I had to anyway, but he should understand that this is not the way airbnb works! Also, in the contract, the dates were listed wrong and he asked me twice to deposit an extra $2k+ in addition to the airbnb. I then emailed him to ask, but he said it was a mistake, but twice?! He also listed some ridiculous rules like any trash bags left behind would cost $30 and it will be taken off your deposit. Cleaning up after the guests is part of the airbnb deal, if you don't like it, don't rent it out. Overall, it was a very distasteful experience. "
135,-1,"Sarah is a very kind host. My friend and I stayed here for the Boston Marathon along with another couple in for the same reason, and we had a nice stay.

There was some confusion with the rooms at first, but Sarah took care of it for us without too much trouble.

The only main detraction from staying here is that it was a bit inconvenient to get in and out of the more central part of Boston, and there wasn't much going on in the area - my friend and I didn't spend much time hanging around the area except to come home and sleep. 

Otherwise, Sarah and her family were very nice and welcoming. The room was comfortable, and she provided a mini fridge for us to use, already stocked with milk and some other supplies, along with coffee, tea, and breakfast cereal. 

Thanks, Sarah!"
136,-6,"I am sorry to say that I had a terrible experience at Sarah's place. This was because:
1) The bedroom was so freezing cold on the first night that we couldn't sleep (the bedding was not warm enough)
2) The decor was dingy and there was a range of strange marks/smells
3) The shower was cold on the second morning and never got any hotter
4) Sarah was angry at us for not checking out until 12:30 instead of 12:00 and refused to keep our luggage until later in the afternoon!
5) I tried to find Sarah to let her know about the water. I knocked but she didn't hear, then when I went in she was accused me of barging into her bedroom! (I had no idea what room it was)
My friend and I were shocked at how we were treated by Sarah. Avoid this place like the plague!"
137,-2,Sarah's room is at the top of 2 narrow stairs which made it difficult for my mom to get up and down. Also the hot water was sporadic in the bathroom sink. Overall it was an adequate air Bnb experience but definitely no frills. 
138,-2,"Bernie was overwhelmingly welcoming, offering to carry bags, a tour of the apartment and the rest of the building. He was very accommodating with unclear arrival times due to flight delays/cancellations. Apartment furnishing were perfect. There is a shared bathroom with another guest which was not a problem. Provided shampoo and soap which was unexpected and appreciated. "
139,-1,"Overall this is a good property in a great location. Whilst not Cara's fault, there are a few things that her landlord needs to fix, including leaky toilets, noisy air-conditioning and sub-standard electrical wiring and power points throughout. The location in the midst of Beacon Hill is ideal, being very close to Charles St, and just a few blocks from the T station. "
140,-1,"Ce fut un séjour très agréable, dans un quartier populaire et animé,  la maison est tout près de la ""Dudley station""  bus/tram, ce qui est un atout indéniable.

La chambre est propre et pourvue de tout le confort  nécessaire, elle possède aussi une salle de bains attenante spécialement dédiée aux hôtes, j'ai apprécié la double possibilité d'être totalement indépendante et de pouvoir aussi participer à la vie de la maison. La cuisine et le salon étaient à ma disposition. Sarah a aussi un petit garçon aussi souriant qu'elle ! "
141,-1,"This was my first time in Boston, so I didn't know the various areas and I was thrown off by reviews for this space. I wish I had the feedback that I'm providing now -  to base my decision on where to stay. 

I'm sure Sarah and Sam are nice people, but the location of this space is questionable. Buyers beware - you get what you paid for. 

Location - this house is located at the Dudley Square Silver Line T stop (which is a BUS, no trains are close to this location). It's a dead end bus stop - as grim as it gets. Smelly, dirt and trash everywhere...homeless people. Is this really the heart of Boston?

Neighborhood - about a 3 block walk, it's not the  cleanest and a bit (URL HIDDEN) 11:30 am on a Thursday morning, people are hanging out in front if their houses (no jobs?), thumping music, loud conversations that are clearly heard even once you are inside the house. 

Sam met us - he was nice. Showed us around the house. Took us to our room. Room/bed exactly as pictured. Nothing more, nothing less. 

The location and neighborhood just wasn't for us. We rented a hotel room, ordered a cab to pick us up at the house and took off. The remainder of the trip was great, Boston is a neat city! 

Good luck!

143,-1,"Sarah was very friendly and communicative. Her family members were also very welcoming. It was the first time I've stayed in a room in a shared house, and I was pretty nervous about having to share space with other people. I didn't find it awkward or weird at all. Quite the opposite."
144,-1,"VI hade kontakt i god tid före min ankomst och jag ändrade från att komma ensam till att ta med en kompis, och sen tillbaka till ensamboende utan problem. Sarah var även hemma för att släppa in mig vis ankomst ca 22.30 trots att hon var på väg till sitt nattjobb. Allt som var annonserat fanns på plats. Lite långt från centrum men med buss (för en kostnad av 2.60 USD) kom man till South station eller downtown."
145,-3,"I want to start this review by saying that Boston is a great city to visit and for the most part is clean, attractive, and has plenty of activities to offer. 

With respect to this apartment I would not recommend it for anything other than its close location to Fenway park. Upon arriving I noticed that the apartment was very hot and stagnant and there was no air conditioning or fan to move any air around which made for a very uncomfortable sleeping arrangement. Adding to this the bathroom was quite messy with lots of little hairs around both the sink and toilet seat. The bed sheets were not clean and had a very musty smell to them. 

I found all this very ridiculous considering the price that I paid to stay at this place. After contacting the owner about my complaints and requesting a discount on the place he offered to give me a 25% discount on my next stay for which there will be no next stay. 

Thus I would not recommend this place for anyone 



"
146,-1,"Place was quiet, neighborhood didn't seem bad. We only stayed one night as a BAT was found in one of the rooms. Can't blame anyone for that, but it was enough to make us have serious doubts about returning for another night."
147,-1,Great place. Close to the T and shopping. Only a 15min walk to the aquarium. Only big issue was the noise in the front room at night. Construction across the street made it difficult to sleep some nights. But overall great place to stay and definitely recommend!

1.  The bed is extremely firm and, while OK for me, was uncomfortable for my wife.

2.  Sean lowered his daily rate several days before our arrival but wouldn't give me the new rate.  Not unreasonable since we had agreed on the higher price but he could have offered  to split the difference.

We would highly recommend this apartment.

150,-1,"The house is beautiful from the street. Inside?
It could be a charming old house. However, it is so dirty one can not imagine and smells hardly bearable. The staircase is dark at night (some sections have no lights you can put on), God save you from a bad step there. The lack of hygiene is so way out of any reasonable standard you feel to be really cheated when facing such an experience. One is wondering, how can something like this be offered for rent in old Boston without any control e.g. by the company that actually sells it, also for commission?"
151,-1,I just recently stayed in the 4th floor office for 7 nights while attending a function at the Marriott Copley and I couldn't ask for a more convenient location to the hotel and also the Back Bay station. The only issue I had was the narrow steps and spaces throughout the house. I had a large 45lb. suitcase and had a hard time going up and down the stairs. But other than that I didn't mind it for the price. If you're on the larger side and easily awaken with light coming in the room then the 4th filler office is not for you. 
152,-7,"I booked my trip to Boston 6 months ago through Airbnb for this location owned by Peter because of the supposedly good reviews for this location and that it was a clean place.  Arrived at this location on the 16th of August 2016.  Immediately, I was appalled at the condition of the residence, supposedly it having been cleaned before my arrival.  I CALLED Airbnb immediately and informed them of the problems with the address and they stated that they would open a case on these issues.  The following problems were noted and pictures were sent to Airbnb and are listed below:

1. Dirty garbage under the sink, that I had to carry down 7 flights of stairs to be rid of 
2. Moldy fruit and old and used condiments left in the refrigerator
3. Toilet handle broken the first time I used the toilet
4. Bathroom mat was dirty and molded
5. The bathtub and sink would not drain, totally clogged
6. Stained and soiled sheets, pillows, and mattress 
7. Was supposed to have Wi-Fi capability when I had booked this location.  Peter gave me a password but it did not allow me to have access
8. Only able to receive one channel on the TV
9. Rug in the bedroom was very dirty 


I called the owner and he stated that he was out of town but would come over and address my issues on Thursday, the 18th of August.  In the meantime Peter advised me to call his plumber, which I did, and he arrived the next day and fixed the problems.  Peter arrived on Thursday in the evening and I and my brother met with him.  As I addressed each problem his demeanor and attitude was very dismissive.  He stated that because of the location people stay at this address just because it is in the North End of Boston.  Apparently, in his view, all these were minor problems and the cleanness has not been an issue.  I spent a whole day cleaning the place.  Peter did refund the cleaning fee via a check.

To make my stay more comfortable and not wanting to sleep on dirty linens, my brother brought over clean linens, pillows and a new bath mat.

159,-1,"The top feature is convenience--the row house is about a 5-minute walk from Back Bay Station and 10-15 minutes from Copley Square. The accommodations can be described as funky or atmospheric, depending on expectations. "
160,-1,"Robert is a paragon of hospitality and accomodation. He is an academic and his home can rival any public library. The location is perfect: walking distance in minutes to Back Bay T. i walked to many destinations and did all my sightseeing with no problem and safely. The brownstone is ornate but worn. My parlor room was spacious and clean. i wish it had an armoir or even a closet with hangers: a bit challenging to live out of a suitcase for a week and not having one hook to even hang a wet towel.
"
161,-3,"Robert was very communicative, and there were no major problems with the overall AirBnB coordination experience.  That said, the other reviews for this location do not accurately describe the listing.  ""Historic"" and ""run down"" are two very different things, and unfortunately, this house is in the latter category.  While the room looks nice in the pictures online, the rest of the house appears to be a fire hazard due to the abundance of books, etc. on shelves in the hallways.  The house is nearing hoarder-status.  I also have dust allergies, and the books and old furniture (note that I did not call them antiques) really set them off. Had I been with my wife on this work trip, we would have immediately left and found another place to stay. Robert seems to be a very nice person, but this house is not suitable for AirBnB in its current form.  The house was not dirty, per se, but the amount of random ""stuff"", poor lighting, and piles everywhere made this an uncomfortable experience. "
162,-1,"Robert was a nice host. The place is a bit strange, as you have to use a bathroom that is connected directly to the kitchen where people sit and have breakfast. Kind of weird."
163,-1,"Mein Freund und ich haben unseren Aufenthalt hier sehr genossen. Das gesamte Haus ist toll und unsere Zimmer mit eigenem Bad war einfach super. Alles war sauber und liebevoll eingerichtet. In der Küche gab es morgens Kaffee, Cereals und Bagels zum selbstbedienen. 
Man braucht zwar eine Weile (ca 20 min) bis man in Boston City ist, da Jamaica Plain doch etwas außerhalb liegt, aber der Stadtteil ist sehr schön und es gibt Restaurants, Cofeeshops und kleine Supermärkte in laufnähe. 
Alles in allem sehr gelungen! Würden es auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen und jederzeit wieder kommen. "
164,-1,"Leider haben wir die Gastgeberin nicht zu sehen bekommen, wir hatten aber detaiilierte Instruktionen, um unser Zimmer zu beziehen. Ein paar kleine Fragen bei unserer Ankunft wurden unverzüglich per Text-Message beantwortet.
Das Zimmer lag im 1. OG eines zauberhaften Hauses in einer schönen und sehr ruhigen Wohngegend.
Die Einrichtung war wunderschön und bestach durch viele kleine Details, besonders viel Wert lag auf einem künstlerischen Gesamteindruck.
Zimmer und Bad waren hell und extrem sauber, auch die zur Verfügung gestellte Wäsche war makellos. Alles funktionierte, sogar das WLAN.
Wir fanden die Kosten für die drei Übernachtungen sehr angemessen und können die Unterkunft ohne Einschränkung weiter empfehlen."
165,-2,"Das Zimmer ist sehr toll, besonders das eigene Bad ist ein großes Plus. Das Bett war wie beschrieben nicht das größte, aber für ein Pärchen leicht ausreichend. 
Victoria ist sehr freundlich und war zwar bei unser Ankunft nicht anwesend, aber per Textnachricht immer sofort erreichbar.
Zum Frühstück kann man sich bei Kaffee und Kleinigkeiten wie Oatmeal und Müsli bedienen. 
Die Gegend ist sehr nett und es gibt viele kleine Restaurants, Pubs und Bakeries. Es gibt auch sehr schöne Parks in der Nähe z.B. das Arboretum der Harvard Universität. Man geht ca. 10 Minuten zur U-Bahn-Station und fährt dann auch noch ein Weilchen ins Zentrum. 
Wir würden diese Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und kommen gerne wieder."
166,-2,"Dies war meine erste airbnb-Erfahrung und es war grossartig. Victoria ist eine hervorragende Gastgeberin und ich hätte es für meinen Aufenthalt in Boston nicht besser treffen können. Jeden Abend habe ich mich gefreut, nach einem ereignisreichen Tag wieder ""heim"" zu kommen. Victoria hat sich immer sofort auf eine Frage gemeldet. Alles ist so oder noch besser wie in der Beschreibung. Ich komme in jedem Fall wieder!"
167,-2,"Everything fit the description perfectly. Only issue that my guest and I felt was weird was that the walls were rather thin, and the floorboards creak slightly so it can feel as though you are making a ruckus, even though you're probably not. Originally, we thought that the owners lived in the other doors in the apartment, but (we believe) that is not the case. "
168,-1,Marcia est très disponible et fait tout pour rendre le séjour le plus agréable possible.
169,-1,"Dangerous, shady neighborhood, did not feel safe so we didn't stay, he refused to refund, took every penny. Do not stay with a person with such low character. "
170,-2,"La maison située dans East Boston est très sympathique, propre et pas loin du métro (arrêt ""airport"" de la blue line).
La cuisine est équipée avec lave vaisselle, micro onde, cafetière et autre!! Vraiment très bien!
La chambre dispose d'un lit confortable, de rangements et d'un sèche cheveux (pour celles qui ne pourraient s'en passer!).
Pourtant elle est quand même plutôt petite et il est impossible d'ouvrir la fenêtre (climatisation oblige).
Nous passerons tout de même 5  nuits agréables dans un quartier assez calme."
171,-4,"This room was quite disappointing. The instructions on how to find the room were extremely unclear, the cleanliness was severely lacking, and the other tenants were loud, making an early bedtime impossible. I was very disappointed with my stay and would not recommend it."
172,-2,The neighborhood is sketchy and their was nobody at the home to welcome me. The room was shockingly small and not very clean. The bed was in horrible condition and was topped with a musty comforter. There was a towel with a huge bleach stain on the bed. I opened the window to let some air in the room and after ten minutes decided to leave. I booked another room in a different area and was much happier.
173,-1,It was a chill experience. I would stay there again. Thanks Izzy!
174,-3,Brooke is in the middle of a renovation so things were a bit dusty and unsettled. Nonetheless the bedroom was spacious and street noise pretty much died down by 11 pm. Brooke is personable and accommodating.  We shared the room with a large fish tank but Brooke was willing to let us turn off the noisy aerator when we asked. 
175,-2,"Location was fantastic and the view at night was great for adding colour to entertaining. Small issues detracted from the overall decor. The leather lounge suite was very worn. The bedrooms were disappointing because the curtains were inadequate and some walls and windows needed repair. Being a penthouse and for the price, these items should have been fixed. "
176,-2,"The area is excellent, however, the accommodations are not worth the price that is charged.  TVs do not work, the cooking utensils are limited and do not fit the stove.  The showers are very cramped.  The sink did not drain because the drain plug was stuck.  The lights flickered at times.  The rooms were tiny.  Sleeping eight is a stretch.  "
177,-6,"The penthouse apt. was very nice. However, the elevator wasn't working, and we had to climb 6 flights (4 times, as it ended up). That can happen. However there were other problems that a checklist would have corrected. The cooling did not work until an air conditioning contractor was called (the apt was in the 80s when we arrived after climbing stairs). First, the thermostat in the LR didn't control the cooling, though the sign on it warned against setting it too low. We later were told the cooling was controlled by a thermostat behind the front door, in a closet or niche, but it was inoperable because the battery needed replacement. There was no bath or hand soap, an omission we did not discover until we were ready to shower -- then an 8 block walk to buy soap. The coffeemaker is broken (line that distributes hot water to the grounds was missing); the filters provided were the wrong type (we poured boiling water manually); the toaster oven on/off knob was missing; remote controls on bedroom TVs didn't work (discovered 2 could be turned on at the device on last morning); the front lights in sw bedroom didn't work (had to climb riser to turn on the rear set); the shower head in upstairs hall bathroom aimed at the wall (bracket was broken), so couldn't be used.  I always leave a tip for housekeepers -- they have the worst job -- but didn't this time because a basic review would have solved most of these problems. If they had turned the AC on before our arrival on a hot day, they would have known it didnt work.  A great apartment made very unpleasant by neglect of little things."
178,-4,"The hosts were welcoming and allowed us to use any and all facilities in the apartment. Christina had some subway passes that she gave me to get around the city. The apartment itself was dingy despite the attempt to use bright colors on the walls. Everything had a layer of grime. The door handles were loose and the sink in the bathroom didn't drain. The whole complex inside reeked of weed the entire time I stayed. Bring earplugs because the room faces the main street and ambulances and cop cars pass all night long. There is really no consideration for guests. I would not stay here again.
"
179,-1,"My husband and I were very disappointed with our stay. The photos aren't the same photos as the room itself. These photos show a bay window and a much larger kitchen, and our room had a (non-bay) window that was covered with fire escapes and overlooked another brick building and the kitchen was significantly smaller. On top of that, a lamp didn't work, the water in the tub wouldn't drain, and it was overall in very shabby condition. We were shocked at the price we paid for a motel quality room. Needless to say, we won't be staying here again. At the price they're charging, you're better off at a hotel.

The one good thing I will say is that the location is excellent."
180,-1,"Actually I booked three nights for my son who spent Sping Break in Boston. No doubt he enjoyed his stay with Roger and Sophie, even joined the Wedding of their neighbour. What a surprise! I think I shall experience myself once I travel to Boston."
181,-1,"Merci à Steve, c'est un homme très sympathique, c'est dommage que nous ne l'ayons rencontré que la veille de notre départ, les autres locataires étaient gentils et nous ont renseignés, entre autre pour trouver le métro qui est tout près, ce qui est très pratique pour se rendre partout où nous voulons aller !  Nous avons pu laisser l'auto devant la maison tout le temps de notre séjour et utiliser les transports en commun, ce qui est très pratique."
182,-1,"Nous n'avons pas réellement rencontrer Steve durant nos 3 jours. 
Mais il à toujours répondu aux message, et aux questions que nous avions à propos du logement. 
La chambre était très bien, spacieuse et propre. 
Surprise de voir autant de monde cohabiter, mais pour passer seulement 2 nuits ce n'était pas un problème. 
Seul problème, le partage de la salle de bain avec les autres personnes qui louait une chambre. (Laisser les serviettes de bain n'importe ou, les cheveux partout..) bref, cela ne donne pas envie d'engager la conversation.
Mais sinon tout à très bien été.

Merci encore Steve."
183,-1,"un très beau séjour chez Steve, la résidence est tout près du métro et de l'épicerie et quelques commerces. Tout est à notre disposition pour passer un bon séjour"
184,-1,"L'appart de VJ est idéal pour visiter la ville: c'est très propre, il y a tout ce qui faut et bien situé (commerces, restos et transports en commun).

VJ est un hôte très attentionné : c'est appréciable de trouver un appart climatisé, de l'eau et autres boissons au frais et des choses à grignoter !
L'entrée et la sortie de l'appart se sont bien passées, VJ est très arrangeant.
Je recommande chaudement cet appart et garde l'adresse sous le coude au cas où !"
185,-1,"I got to wait 15 mins before checking in because the place wasn't ready.Came in and place was all dusty. Seems like a nice place, but dusty. My mom and i had to spend 45 mins to clean the room. Half of the power outlets are broken. I open the wardrobe and it's not even installed yet.There's stain on the blanket too. I know it says in the listing it'll get noisy on like weekends and especially at  night due to the place facing towards the street and there are holes on the window too . So i guess you can judge how my experience went."
186,-3,"This spot is great for those that wish to stay in a great location at a cheap price. Expect nothing more and nothing less.  The building is old and everything felt a bit dirty but if you just need a place to crash this is it. 
Here is my experience: 
Air conditioning was advertised but was not installed.  It was a hot/humid weekend so had I known there was no AC I would have rented elsewhere. Having prepaid for this place, I felt a bit cheated.
Ahmed and I ended up exchanging over 20 messages for the next two days to coordinate the installation of the AC, which is not something I want to be doing on a business trip/vacation. This disorganization  caused unnecessary stress and led to him asking us to leave the apartment to install the AC only to return with the AC not installed. I had to make changes to my schedule and be out of the apartment for a certain time period of the day to accommodate for something that should have been taken care of prior to my arrival and in the end nothing happened. This ordeal was beyond irritating and highly unprofessional. 
Ahmed was nice enough to lend us his office space so that I could do my work and even comped me a night for the inconvenience. However, all this could have been avoided. I appreciate the partial refund and gratuity on his part but I'd much rather pay more for a seamless experience elsewhere and not be bothered on my vacation.  Wouldn't rent again. "
187,-1,The pictures of the apartment are attractive but the truth is not the same. The blinds of all the windows are broken so you live in the dark. In fact it's not important because the windows are so dirty that we can't see outside. The windows are broken so you're sleeping in the street. The shower is  broken and fixed by a big yellow scotch.
188,-1,"Der ""Check in"" verlief reibungslos und ohne Probleme. Die Lage der Wohnung ist absolut zentral! Fantastisch! Bars, Cafes, Restaurants, U-Bahn, etc. ist  in 5 Minuten Fußweg zu erreichen.
Das Apartment selbst ist exakt wie auf den Fotos beschrieben. Wenn man nicht gerade das Ritz Carlton erwartet, wird man nicht negativ überrascht werden. Geräuschempfindliche Menschen könnten sich von der hellhörigen Wohnung eventuell gestört fühlen. Da ich außerhalb meiner Wohnung immer mit Ohrenstöpseln schlafe, ist dies für mich nicht relevant gewesen.
"
189,-5,"Host did not make us feel welcome. They did not reach out to us. After badgering the contact number for two hours after the check in time, we were told someone else was managing the apartment and should have gotten a hold of us. We were worried this was going to be an Airbnb horror story. Eventually the manager called us and was very rude. The bed was miserably uncomfortable and noisy. The blinds barely blocked out any of the light from outside and the room was very loud the whole night. Finally, we were told to check out an hour before the advertised time. This was our first bad airbnb experience."
190,-2,"We did not deal with Jean much until the very end, but her other tenant Scotty was fantastic. He was so kind and helpful. The neighborhood can be a bit rough, but as long as you stay aware of your surroundings you should be fine. The air conditioning was a great touch, but it would shut off randomly which was really frustrating at night when you were trying to sleep.

The bed was incredibly loud and squeaky. After the first night we removed the mattress from the box spring and just slept with the mattress on the floor. That eliminated the squeak noise. "
191,-1,"Though we didn't meet r Hermina Sarkissian herself, we met Donna, who had been informed of our comming. We had no problem with this. 
The house, and the room which was given to us was corresponding to the description.  "
192,-1,"Well, the house is located close to subway, 3 mins walk to subway, the room D doesn't have air conditioning, and it was like 34 celcius degrees, so imagine the heat, it was like living hell, couldn't  breathe, and it was too noisy, loud vehicle and motors sound kept waking us"
193,-1,"Très bon logement. Cuisine superbe. Salle de bain magnifique. Literie confortable, a l'exception du lit gonflable, peu confortable. Appartement tres bien situé, proche de Copley. Très calme et confortable. Lisa vous laissera quelques provisions, de quoi vous régaler.  Petit bémol: trouver une place de parking n'est pas facile, mais c'est pareil dans tout boston."
194,-3,"Bernard a été très accueillant et compréhensif. Je voyageais avec mon mari et mon bébé. J'ai dû quitter au bout d'une nuit puisqu'avec tout le bruit (alarme de pompier, police, etc.) mon bébé était incapable de dormir. 3 des mes amies sont venues prendre ma place afin de ne pas perdre ma réservation et Bernard a été très compréhensif. L'appartement est tel qu'indique. "
195,-1,"C'était notre première expérience avec Airbnb et nous avons été ravis de séjourner chez Kristina et Chris. Kristina a maintenu un contact régulier avec nous jusqu'à notre arrivée où elle nous a accueillis de façon très amicale. Elle avait pris soin de nous laisser une carte du quartier avec les attraits/restos/commerces du coin, très utile pour se repérer rapidement en arrivant. Points positifs du studio : très propre, tout avait été mis à notre disposition (vaisselle, four, grille-pain, café, serviette, savon, etc.) pour que notre séjour soit des plus agréables. Nous n'avons manqué de rien! Nous avons adoré le quartier: petits restos sympas, buanderie, marché d'alimentation bio, superbe parc (avis aux joggeurs!), etc. La station de métro est à 3 min à pied, ce qui facilite l'accès au centre-ville (20 min de T environ). L'emplacement est donc idéal si vous passez la journée au centre-ville et revenez seulement le soir (le studio étant tout de même éloigné du centre-ville) ou si vous voulez explorer un coin moins touristique de Boston, mais tout aussi charmant et coloré. Jamaica Plain est un coup de cœur, particulièrement pour son esprit communautaire. Nous nous sommes sentis en sécurité. Nous pouvions d'ailleurs laisser notre voiture dans la rue gratuitement et sans problème. Nous reviendrons!"
196,-5,"Check-in was easy and convenient. Even though we arrived early and went to the rental office to drop our bags, the woman at the desk arranged for us to check in early to the apt and drop our bags while the cleaner was still there. The location is great, in the heart of the Back Bay. Now the Oh-no-nos: the carpet is gross and should be ripped out. It was so old and dirty-looking I didn't want to step on it in bare feet. The AC was set to 78 and we couldn't turn it any lower so it was stuffy and hot the whole time (it was 90 outside). We called the office and someone came to ""fix"" it but it still never went below 78 so they must set it that high on purpose. Not OK. The apartment is in the basement and the lighting is poor - it's either really low so you can't see, or blinding. No in-between. There should be more space to hang things in the bathroom. The hook was missing from the back of the door so there was no place except a tiny towel rack to hang anything . Also, the shelf above the sink was tilted so you couldn't store anything there and there's no medicine cabinet or other storage space so we ended up putting our things on the toilet tank or the floor. One of the leather chairs in the living room was ripped, and the sofa also felt old and a bit dingy. For us, the location didn't make up for all of the inconveniences and problems. YMMV."
197,-1,This apartment has an amazing location and has a really relaxed vibe inside. It wasn't as clean as a hotel but that is to be expected. The big downside for me was that there is normally a cat living there and as someone who is allergic to cats that would have a been a deal breaker when considering booking. I started having allergy symptoms within the first hour of being there and thats a bummer when you're on vacation! 
198,-3,"I was contacted by Alisa the day before, telling that she would't be able to check us in before 8:30 although the advertisement says 13:00. Since we were traveling from Niagara and we drove the whole day it was disappointing to not be able to get in before 8:30. Also, we were there by 8:30 but the couple (Alisa and Kacey) was still about 20 minutes late - not pleasant after a 8 hour drive.

I was also told ""I am preparing for your arrival today and tomorrow"".
The house was not dirty - but it was clearly not clean either, nor was ready for us. Some of the bed linen were smelly (like weird smelling), although later Alisa confirmed that they were coming from the drier just before we arrived (wasn't supposed to be already prepared?). The dishwasher was full with the guests dishes - which we had to wash by ourselves during our stay.
Although the WiFi PW was on the fridge, we didn't really get instruction until the day after.

We were pretty disappointed when we first arrived.

The noise from the railway is not a problem if you keep the windows closed, which we did - although the apartment would get ridiculous warm and not that comfortable during the night - I am talking about 81 to 85 F. We are used to sleep with 65-70, so it was pretty uncomfortable.

We also were asked to leave before 12.00, although the advertisement says 13.00.

The experience was not bad, but being on holiday we definitely felt unwelcome when we first arrived. After that first moment, the stay was ok.
The price is a bit high for what you get, considering that we paid 25$ for cleaning fees as well!"
199,-2,"Le condo était parfait pour notre séjour à Boston. Situé dans le quartier enchanteur de Beacon Hill, cet immeuble a été construit en 1860 et fait parti du régistre national des sites historiques!  Le tout était rénové au goût du jour et que dire du quartier: à quelques pas de petits cafés ainsi que du Boston Common.  Une station de métro était disponible à proximité quoique nous avons vraiment apprécié notre marche jusqu'au centre-ville (+/- 20 minutes).  En résumé, je recommande vraiment cet endroit."
200,-1,"We didn't meet Adam but that was not a problem. The apartment was perfect as was the location. I had been to Boston before so I had a very good idea where the apartment would be and was not disappointed. 
The only issue is that the apartment is in a walk-up - fourth floor. Not a problem for most but it did impact on the amount of luggage we brought - we were only there for 4 days so not a big issue. First time with airbnb and will certainly use again."
201,-2,"Nous avons été très déçus par cette adresse : chambre minuscule où il était difficile d'ouvrir deux valises en même temps salle de bain pas nette du tout, ressources pour le petit déjeuner très banales ! Bref nous en sommes partis sans regret, rien à  voir avec les autres adresses Airbnb ! Le tout pour plus de 70 dollars ! A rayer de son carnet d'adresse"
202,-1,"This is a sub-divided house, with numerous guest rooms in the one building. It's really easy to get around the city, as the house is really close to a train station. And the room itself was quite large - your own TV, cupboard, sink, kettle and lots of room to sit around. Not sure about the other rooms in the house.

There is also a shared fridge, bathroom and laundry.

The room was very nice, but as we were on the basement level there was quite a lot of noise coming through the floorboards. We kept quite late hours so it never affected our sleep, but if you are a light sleeper it could cause some problems."
203,-1,"La maison est située tout près du métro permettant d'aller facilement dans le centre de Boston.

Très belle expérience !"
204,-2,"Enorme déception ! Personne à l'arrivée, logés dans un sous-bassement avec seulement une petite lucarne et tous les bruits de tuyauterie de toilettes de toutes les chambres. La maison de la photo est coupée en deux avec chacune salon, salle à manger trois chambres à l'étage et une au sous-sol donc en tout 8 chambres ! Ce n'est pas ma conception B&B. En plus le quartier n'est pas top (regardez sur Internet)

Huge disappointment! Nobody was there when we arrived, the flat is underground with only a small window and we were hearing noises coming from the pipes of all the toilets of the house. The house on the picture is cut in 2 with in both parts: living room, dining room and 3 bedrooms upstairs. This brings to 8 the number of bedrooms with the 2 underground! It is not my vision of B&B. Moreover, the neighborhood is not great (check on internet).
"
205,-4,"Room C is in the attic, narrow stairway without light.  Light bulb burned out. Air conditioner very noisy, hard to sleep. Mattress on floor, a bit claustrophobic.  Sketchy neighborhood.  Close to subway."
206,-1,"I stayed with Hermina for a couple of nights with my parents. She was very welcoming. The listing is in the attic of the house with slanted roofs (3rd floor) which I failed to take in to account as my mom has trouble climbing up stairs. Other than that, a comfortable stay. "
207,-2,"Feedback :
1) Boiling water kettle too dirty to use
2) Towel don't look comfortable to use

208,-1,"Vi hade en härlig höstvecka i Tom lägenhet i Boston. Den var stor, välutrustad och låg mycket bra till för våra behov. Omgivningarna var trevliga, nära till både parker, resturanger och allmänna kommunikationer. Samtidigt var området mycket lugnt och hemtrevligt. Det var inte heller några problem att parkera bilen på gatan utanför. 
Det fanns en beskrivning över var man kunde hitta livsmedelsaffärer och rekommenderade resturanger, och hur man enklast tog sig in till centrum. Vi träffade inte Tom, utan pratade bara med honom i telefon, men nyckelöverlämningen gick mycket smidigt och allt fungerade bra så det fanns ingen anledning att ha kontakt med Tom.
Vi rekommenderar detta ställe för en familj eller större sällskap som inte har behov av att bo mitt i Boston, utan föredrar en lugnare miljö som fortfarande erbjuder många resturanger."
209,-3,"I rented the condo because it had two bedrooms and two bathrooms.
However one bathroom was unavailable because of a planned remodel.  After talking to Tom about the inconvenience of having workmen in the condo during our stay, Tom agreed to wait until we checked out before work on the remodel continued.  
The condo is on the first floor.  A couple with a young child live in the upstairs unit.  The child was constantly in motion beginning in early morning.  It was extremely loud and annoying."
210,-1,Due to a fire at an air traffic control center out here in the Midwest my flight was cancelled so I never actually stayed at Liesl's place.  What was rather surprising was that the airline & the restaurants we booked both refunded any charges due to the unusual nature of the circumstances but Liesl was unresponsive to Airbnb's request to refund our reservation. I was left with a disappointing taste. 
211,-1,L'appartement est bien situé proche d'une station de métro pour accéder directement au centre de Boston. Quartier sympa avec quelques restos et bars. Chambre propre et assez grande mais pas de clim ce qui est quand même gênant en été. Yu Chen est un hôte très arrangeant qui nous a attendu jusqu'à minuit le jour de notre arrivée mais qui est resté très discret tout au long de notre séjour. 
212,-1,"Flight delayed, didn't get a chance to stay."
213,-1,He was personable host! He gave some tips to get charles river and to get to the airport. Also the apartment is near the greenline. So easy to get to downtown and art museum.  But the room is near the noise elevator.. so it was little bit annoying.
214,-1,"Nous avons passé un bon moment chez YuChen. La chambre était très propre, le lit confortable. La mise à disposition d'une carafe d'eau avec deux verres dans la chambre a été très appréciée.

Nous n'avons vu YuChen qu'une seule fois à notre arrivée, et il a été très discret tout au long de notre séjour. Toutefois, les instructions pour le check-in et le check-out étaient précises, ce qui est appréciable, et nous n'avons jamais eu l'impression d'être livrés à nous-mêmes. Tous ces éléments combinés ont sans aucun doute contribué à rendre notre séjour à Boston agréable !"
215,-1,"The location was nice, however the sheets were dirty when we checked in and the person who was responsible for cleaning came in after we arrived, and we had to leave while they cleaned the rest of apartment. We were a little hesitant about sleeping there after that. The apartment was a bit dirty, missing garbage bags and the amenities were lacking (no toothpaste).

The building was nice as well, however the check in process was mechanical. No answers to questions, just a copy + paste statement to any communication. Despite the apartment having some nice, modern features, I would likely would not choose to stay here again."
216,-1,"Het verblijf bij Hannah was precies wat we nodig hadden! Nog geen 3 minuten lopen van de Subway en je bent meteen waar je wil zijn. Ook in de buurt waren leuke restaurantjes. Het huis was heel schoon en had airco, zeker een must voor deze tijd van het jaar. "
217,-5,"I will not recommend this room for many reasons.
First, the bed squeaks, loudly! The bed is full size I believe. The springs inside the mattress kept me awake all night. The pillow, sheet and quilt is not very clean as you can smell something you don't want to. The floor is unbelievable dirty! No one have never cleaned it. If your cloth drops on the floor, when you pick it up, you will see dirt.
No AC, no fans in the room. I was there 9 nights. First 5 nights, the room temp was 85! The other 4 nights, it was 55! And the quilt is so thin. It was too cold, I have to wear all my cloth so I can sleep a little.
No three pin power outlet in the room, I couldn't charge my computer!!!!!! wifi in this room is very weak, you can't even open (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), you have to go to the kitchen if you want to use wifi. Sound proofing of the room is very bad. You can hear everything if you know what I mean.
There are 4 rooms in the house to share one bath. There is a trash can in the bath and someone will come here clean it every many days! It can be very full and smells!
Overall speaking. The house is close to the Red line, the neighborhood is okay. But, the room is just not very good. So, if you really care about the bed, the sanitation of the room, I suggest you go somewhere else."
218,-9,"My mum and I stayed here for about a week. We just wanted to start of by saying that we aren't crazy and high demanding people. First, we booked this room but the owner was about to let us stay downstairs in an uglier room without asking us. Second, the apartment had an uncomfortable odor that we had to buy candles on the first night there because we couldn't stand the smell. Also, the kitchen was dirty, and both the floor and bed were dusty. The bathroom was a mess with random things made as decorations. The owner didn't give us enough toilet papers to use so we had to use tissues and napkins. At night, it got so dark that we couldn't be able to see so when we left the apartment in the afternoon, we had to leave the lights in the hallway on. The owner was uncomfortable with that which was just ridiculous. We've been to so many Airbnb apartments with the same price before and they were all much higher quality. We will not recommend this place at all. It was the worst experience of Airbnb that we've ever had."

2. The hosts have a pack and play available (a big plus when travelling with an infant)
3. The apartment is relatively clean and nicely decorated 
4. Had a good quality inflatable mattress in the closet 

Cons: 
1. Looks NOTHING like the pictures (a total scam) 
2. loud AC, 
3. no widows in 2 of the 3 the bedrooms (so technically can't be considered ""bedrooms"")
4. weak wifi connection 
5. cheap toilet paper
6. uncomfortably painful water pressure from the shower-head
7. uncomfortable mattresses "
220,-1,"Der Code für die Eingangstüren funktionierte einwandfrei. Das beste an diesem Apartment ist definitiv die Lage. In höchstens 15 Minuten ist man zu Fuss bei praktisch jeder Sehenswürdigkeit. Boston Common und die Newbury Street sind gleich um die Ecke.
Zwei der drei Schlafzimmer sind eher klein, zwei grosse Koffer hatten nur knapp oder gar keinen Platz. Ausserdem kann man die Fenster nicht wirklich abdunkeln was dazu führte, dass es bereits um 5 Uhr morgens sehr hell war im Zimmer.
Aufgrund der super Lage und des fairen Preises würden wir aber jederzeit wieder hier übernachten."
221,-2,"We were incredibly disappointed by the poor communication with the host, Anthony. Our reservation was accepted on May 5 for a stay starting on June 29. We messaged Anthony twice through the Airbnb website, texted him, and called him inquiring about check in time and procedure from May 5 to June 28, and had to call Airbnb with concern that we would not have a place to stay due to lack of communication. The Airbnb representative confirmed that Anthony had received and not responded to our messages, and called him to inquire. We did not hear from Anthony until 8:30am on the day of check in, and he claimed that he did not receive any messages.

The actual stay:
Pros:
-Location, location, location. Located right in the heart of North End/Little Italy, you can walk to many restaurants, Mike's Pastry, Faneuil Hall, and Quincy Market.

Cons:
-No windows or natural lighting
-Poor ventilation
-Poor internet and phone connectivity
-Footsteps of tenants above are loud
-Small and uncomforable bed
-Dirty bathroom, which made us question whether sheets were clean and changed, etc.
-Continued poor communication. Anthony would take two hours to respond to our inquiries (about amenities) and did not inform us of check out time or procedure.

We would not stay here again or recommend it to our friends/family."
222,-1,Wonderful location! Near many of Boston's highlighted areas. We didn't spend too much time there other than sleeping and taking a couple rest breaks. Only downside was lack of AC and it got pretty warm and stuffy at night. 
223,-1,"The location of this apartment was fabulous as it was in the heart of the North End/Little Italy and in close walking distance to the waterfront. It was also only about 10 minutes to walk to a subway station.
Unfortunately it was obvious as soon as we descended into the apartment that a lot of smokers had either lived in the apartment or smoke drifted down to it...even the bed smelt of smoke! And of course, because it's a basement apartment, the tiny windows don't help.
We expected, from the the description, that the apartment also appeared to act as storage for Anthony and his family. What surprised us a bit was that the kitchen/fridge also had loads of stuff stored in it (including when we arrived, a couple of mouldy cabbages) and the freezer was full. We noticed over the five nights we were there that people had been into the apartment a few times to either place or remove things from the fridge, which felt intrusive.  
Soon after we got into the apartment we realised there was only a tiny bit of toilet paper and no soap. We messaged Anthony but didn't hear back from him until the next day.
Unfortunately the apartment really didn't appear to have been cleaned properly before we arrived and was more cluttered than appeared in the photos.
The TV is also ancient and a bit flaky.
If you do decide to stay in Anthony's apartment, we would strongly recommend doing his tour of Little Italy to understand the neighbourhood. It's great fun and you taste some great food, culminating in lunch at the apartment above this one (i.e. his parents' place).  We ended up going back to get subs from Monica's deli, pastries from the shop where he bought the pastries on the tour, had a great meal at Trattoria Il Panino, and even bought a freshly baked loaf of bread from the bakery in Hanover St after getting up early one morning to watch the sunrise.  We didn't get the home cooked meal though."
224,-1,"die lage der wohnung ist toll und Antony und seine eltern waren sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich! aber es war unsere bei weitem teuerste (wenngleich nicht gerade gemütlichste) AirBnB-unterkunft während einer 4 wöchigen reise durch den USA-osten. dass die räume sehr niedrig und im basement sind, wurde zwar angekündigt, aber da es keine fenster bzw. die möglichkeit zu tageslicht gibt, fühlt man sich leicht wie ""eingekellert"" ;(! entschädigt wird man wie gesagt durch die tolle lage mitten in Little Italy, wo man in 5-10 min fußmarsch beim Aquarium od. downtown, in 3-4 min bei der metro und v.a. ""gleich um die ecke"" beim ""Greenway"" ist, wo man vorm schlafengehen nochmal gemütlich im freien (!) sitzend den tag revue passieren lassen kann!"
225,-4,"Overall,on a scale of one to ten,  this property would rate a 5.  Pictures  of apartment are much better than in person. Furniture was worn with paint splashes on dining chairs, couch faded and stained. Kitchen was definitely not as clean as should be. We , thankfully brought Clorox wipes with us to clean stove, dishwasher and toaster oven.  Half bath sink leaked, front doorknob fell off, patio and outside furniture was filthy. No way could we sit outdoors to enjoy that space.  One large window in living room was boarded up with plywood.  Landlord explained they had a bad winter and ice had damaged window....but this was middle of May!  This apartment has no central air.  Landlord stated when I called window units were not needed as yet.  Place was ,therefore very stuffy.  Doors to a utility closet fell off..nearly scared us to death.  When I complained to landlord unit was dirty, her response was , ""It is clean... but old.""  Linens may have been clean but were very faded and should be replaced. Good things?  Have to say, beds were comfortable, inside of fridge was clean (certainly not the top) and yes,it is in a good location.  If you are driving, however, be prepared to pay dearly for parking and you must pick car up from overnight parking by 8:00 AM . (Hence, no sleeping in on vacation.) Myself and fellow travelers agreed we would never stay here again.  Perhaps we are used to better accommodations."
226,-1,"We did not know that this apartment was a 3 flight walk up. We suggest that information be included in the description. For that reason, we were unable to stay in the apartment. Also, it is an area where on street parking is very difficult. Therefore, we did not actually see the apartment. Jordan was gracious in understanding that we could not stay in the apartment due to the many stairs."

Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt und hatten ein bezauberndes Zimmer, das perfekt vorbereitet war. 
Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Straße und bis zur nächsten Bahnstation sind es nur ein paar Minuten zu Fuß. 
Unsere Gastgeber und die anderen Gäste waren alle durchweg freundliche, hilfsbereite und aufgeschlossene Personen und wir haben den Kontakt mit ihnen sehr genossen. Sollten wir noch mal nach Boston kommen, wird dies hoffentlich wieder unsere Unterkunft sein!"
230,-1,"During my stay there was a radiator leak, which involved some construction. Ed was very good at communicating throughout the stay and finding a way to allow me to stay despite the issues. I'm looking forward to staying again sometime in the future. "
231,-1,"Great location but definitely not the cleanest place we have ever stayed.

Photos were quite deceptive - apartment is quite small and quite messy- lots of wiring from the tv and extension cables left hanging in front of bookshelves for example. Lots of shards of broken glass on the patio so you shouldn't go out barefoot. The apartment above has wooden floors so it is very very noisy - we didn't get a lot of sleep. The bed is a small double and is not very comfortable. Lots of books = lots of dust. The apartment was quite damp and the linen/towels didn't smell good. If you want to use the washer or dryer it's $1.75 a go so the first thing we did when we got there is re-wash the towels and linen and give the bathroom and kitchen a good clean!!

The shower was weird - a plastic cubicle which felt very basic - noticed a lot of black mould in the sealant (as well as a LOT of black hairs on the bathroom floor which grossed me out!!) Opened the fridge and it had some old food in there and really needed a good clean. 

Great care has been taken when photographing the apartment - photos have been tactically taken and furniture moved so it looks bigger and brighter than it is.

Overall if you just want location and a place to crash for a night then this place is fine - but we were on our honeymoon and stayed for five nights so we were very disappointed, especially when we came home to find the flat upstairs having a party on the supposedly private patio which looks directly into the apartment.

Sofas were quite worn and uncomfortable - carpets need replacing as they were thin and very stained. A/C was useless and noisy so the apartment was very very warm. 

Ed was a good communicator but it's always nice to arrive in an apartment that has fresh coffee/milk for example (we have sometimes been given a bottle of wine, especially when you pay as much as we did!) but unfortunately the only thing we found was mouldy food! we have stayed in a few air bnb places and this is the first negative review I have had to write. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would however recommend the area - it was really the only thing that we liked about our stay.

232,-1,"Die Unterkunft war genau so wie beworben. Das gesamte Haus war sehr sauber. Die Handtücher sowie die Bettwäsche waren frisch. WLAN war uneingeschränkt nutzbar. Fanny ist eine sehr zuvorkommende und freundliche Gastgeberin. Die Lage der Wohnung ist in Ordnung. Es existieren mehrere Anschlüsse per Bus an den T-Stop Andrew Station der Red Line. Nach 10 Minuten Fußmarsch ist man an der Haltestelle ""Uphams Corner"" der Commuter Rail. In Summe ist man in circa 30 bis 40 Minuten in Boston Downtown. Das Viertel ist sowohl tagsüber als auch nachts ungefährlich. Ich würde jederzeit wieder in dieser Unterkunft hausen."

Seule petite remarque on sent que l'appartement n'est loué que pour des courtes durées il n'y a que le strict nécessaire. On se sent plus dans un appart-hôtel que chez un particulier ( notamment si vous souhaitez cuisiner pas de sel ecT..) autrement rien à dire, nous avons passe un très bon séjour sur Boston! Merci pour les bonnes adresses ! À bientôt! "
235,-1,Logement bien situé et exactement comme la description. Tout était parfait durant notre séjour!
236,-3,Don't book this place !!! The nightmare began when my Uber driver drop me off close to where the address wasn't. Yes I said wasn't 11 95 does not exist. They purposely give the wrong address you look at other reviews they've done this to other people. Soon you will understand it is in the basement and the littered with constructions guys food which attracts flies right at your front door. When I first got there I open the apartment to find that the apartment wasn't ready it was still in disarray from the previous guest. I had spoken to Alan I mention that I was going to arrive at midnight. But earlier that day I received a call from Kevin his associate and discuss that I was getting on an earlier flight and would be there around 9 he assured me the apartment would be ready. When the Uber driver drop me off close to what was 1195 to only find out that address does not exist I am mediately called and they told me that it was down the street at 1173 and that Airbnb had the address wrong. I know this is not true because I am an Airbnb host and the host sets the address. I think they do it to not scare people away at first sight and/or they have more than one and toggle people around two other apartments from what I've seen in other reviews. When I arrived the apartment was not cleaned they told me to drop my bags and they would have someone there to clean immediately. Kevin called me he said he was on his way to clean the apartment that he was very apologetic about the misunderstanding. I left to have dinner Kevin called me and said this is so unprofessional but I don't have the keys to the apartment can I come and get them from you which he did. I had dinner and within the hour he told me he was done cleaning would I like to get the keys from him I said no I think you should come and bring them to me since I would like to have dessert. He brought me the keys not looking very happy about the situation. I went back to the apartment and noticed he did a minor cleaning maybe just the bathroom and made the bed but other than that I don't think anything else was cleaned. The apartment is very minimally furnished. So if you like that dorm type look this is the place for you the apartment is in the basement with exposed piping on the ceiling and very loud noises coming from both upstairs and the freight elevator that is right by your back door. Lots of loud noises coming from the hallway in the back area almost scary. In the cupboard I found a coffee cup that had the side of it dripping with old coffee. The shower area was less to be desirable...
237,-1,The room looked just like the picture.  The bathroom was a little bit dirty but to be expected for such a small space.  I did have some trouble communicating with the host.  I asked the address and ended up going back through emails to find it and so I was late to check in.  The host did not meet me there it was another man. I got a text from her asking where I was and the gentleman who let me in seemed to be very frustrated.  I would have liked to see a more professional approach in communication.  
238,-1,"The apartment is in the heart of China Town, very well situated !

241,-2,"Great location! Plenty of great restaurants nearby, and the freedom trail is just a few blocks away. Located close to Haymarket station, which makes it easy to get anywhere in the Boston. Well-stocked kitchen with pots, pans, plates and glasses. Only complaint is that we had a lot of interruptions when we were in the actual apartment. We had a tour of apartment occur and we were not notified about it ahead a time which left us scrambling to get out the door. There was another tour later during our stay and we were notified. We also had someone try to drop off their deposit at our place, another person from a neighboring apartment came to borrow a charger. Twice, we had people try to enter our apartment thinking it was theirs. One of the times they were able to unlock our deadbolt-fortunately we were inside at the time and told them they had the wrong place. Makes me nervous that they keys seem to be the same and that anyone could enter our place if they live in the building. I"
242,-1,"The apartment is really well located. The subway was near as well as the centre of Bosten downtown. Unfortunately the mattress was really uncomfortable. The wifi was bad, sometimes we were offline. We had to wait half an hour until someone opened the door of the house. The prize is quite high for a room without private bathroom. "
243,-3,"The location of this place really can't be beat: easy access to Beacon Hill, the North End, Boston Commons etc. etc. etc. 

The room is little more than a private hostel room. Quite sparse. The bed in ours was very uncomfortable. In retrospect, the price seems quite high for what we got, but in general accommodation in Boston is quite expensive. 

Tiffany was a bit hard to get ahold of when we were setting up key pick-up a few days before arrival. But we did get in touch and there were no issues after that. "

When I declined, she incessantly harassed us; it got to the point that we had to leave one night early (despite already having paid) and we would have contacted the local authorities were it not for help from the AirBNB trust and safety team. If she makes a similar demand from you, do NOT oblige it - report her to AirBNB and leave *immediately*"

After pleading my case as a busy traveler, he said that he will still honor the accommodation ""this time"". I'm not unreasonable, but his aggression was excessive. The space itself was okay. Older, lingering scents. I would not recommend. "

There was no air conditioning, which would  have been okay but the windows were locked shut and could not be opened. The only furniture was a card table, two chairs and a bed. There was a tiny little stove but no place to make coffee. It was dark, stuffy and very uncomfortable even for one night. The place looked run down and the mail box was broken. We paid the same for a nice hotel room by the airport the next day. "

255,-7,"There are several misleading aspects to this listing that anyone considering this place should know about.

First, I'd like to state that Jean did me a kindness by letting me stay last minute and for allowing my cat to stay there. I had an unfortunate situation with a sublease and needed a place to stay for a month. However, that being said, once conflicts arose, it was clear that Jean was in denial about the state of the place and did not take the appropriate measures to correct it. Jean has not actually been in her property for several months and has not seen the state of it. Instead, she has the two college-aged tenants there to take care of things even though they did not agree to it.

Problem 1: The minute I got there, the room smelled like body odor and nothing was clean. There was short, brown curly hair on the floor with dirt and dust. The sheets also had the same stuff on them. I was told that someone was supposed to have cleaned but apparently didn't. I suppose an unfortunate situation. I overlooked this and cleaned on my own.

Problem 2: I was notified by the roommates that there is a mice problem. Two mice to be exact. I found mouse droppings in my room (which does not look like the picture, btw). When I contacted Jean, she just suggested putting peanut butter in mouse traps... no shock or apology that it was even an issue.

Problem 3: There are no ""nice views"" at this place. In fact, the only appeal to this place is its proximity to the T station. However, be warned that if  you are a girl travelling alone, you should not go outside at night. This area ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it) is known for gunshots and stabbings. I heard several the two weeks I was there. Jean denied this (again, not even being in the same state) and said I must have heard fireworks. I grew up in Texas and own several guns. I know what a gunshot is and this was corroborated by the roommates. Be careful if you choose to stay here.

Problem 4: The listing is advertised as having a washer and dryer. It is actually the worst false advertisement I have encountered. They are located in the basement of the property surrounded by dirt, filth, and general muck. It's clear the washer hose has some sort of leak so where you put your laundry in, you're standing in this gross muddy, dirt puddle. It is not sanitary or healthy in any way and she shouldn't even advertise a washer and dryer at this place.

Look--- if you absolutely want to stay here then ok. The roommates were great. However, it is not worth the amount that's charged and you can find much better in the city in a much safer area. And if you have conflict, don't expect Jean to deal with it at all."
256,-1,"Quick air mattress to crash on near Andrews, just two stops from South Station."
257,-2,"In term of feeling welcome I can say that Jason answered all my questions and my request.  The only request was that the air mattress should be fully inflated, as the first night my hip and shoulder where literary touching the floor.  I was expecting him to monitor the mattress as it seem it was damage and leaking air but it did not happened and it was semi deflated again by the third night.  The area was very isolated and I did not feel safe walking by myself at night. He acknowledge that the area looks shady and that he ”never had a problem with anybody while living in the neighborhood”.  This was written down on a welcome framed letter that he placed in the room.
Even though I never say him, apparently when he stopped by the apartment on my last day and he used the bathroom and left behind a semi open bathroom window.  This window it’s foggy as it’s almost the same level of the next-door neighbor apartment. I had the bad experience that his neighbored was waiting for me to get naked while I was in the bathroom ready to take a shower.  I saw the guys face as he turn around and started running when he realized that I saw him.  Very irresponsible on Jason’s behave, this windows are almost right next to each other. 
I would certainly do not recommend it as a place to stay, certainly if you are a woman.  I strongly recommend Airbnb to take him of their list.

258,-1,Le parking a été très utile lors de notre séjour. Recommandé à de bons conducteurs car la ruelle pour s'y rendre est tout de même très étroite et difficile d'accès. Mais avec un bon conducteur comme Martin nous n'avons pas eu de problème :)
259,-3,"While the apartment and location are fantastic, there were two alarming aspects about the apartments that were not mentioned. We booked one apartment on the 13th floor and the other on the 6th floor. The 6th floor apartment was facing a construction site that woke up even the heaviest of sleepers. But we understand that construction is sometimes unavoidable...however the 13th floor apartment, it was never mentioned that the apartment was in right next to the trash chute. The awful smell of trash pervaded the entire apartment and even after we tried putting candles and air refreshens by our door, the smell persisted. We tried complaining but to no avail. We wish we had known that we were booking an apartment that was neighboring a trash chute, as we  would not have booked it otherwise."
260,-2,"The Apartment is in a good South End location and it's nice, matching the photos. My check in however was most difficult, I have used perhaps 25 - 35 AirBNB locations and have never had this much stress. There are two organisations involved who don't merge well. The ""concierge"" at the door does not work for Flatbook. I arrived at 5:00pm I had a 7:00pm appointment in downtown. 
The ""concierge"" led me to the elevator and explained that the door would be open with keys inside. There were no keys. I had to call Montreal to talk to someone about it and they said they would discuss it with the Boston Manager. I unpacked, putting things in drawers and hanging up nice clothes. After lots of waiting and hassles with both the Montreal folks and the concierge (who were nice enough but couldn't do anything), I decided to leave without the key so I wouldn't be late. It was then I realised I could not lock the door without the key. My choice was to leave my valuables in an unlocked room, take my suitcases with me to the restaurant or be late for my meeting. After nearly two hours I received the keys only to find they didn't work. Eventually I had to move, repack, and switch to a different room (which was hard to get to because I didn't have a key for the elevator). The new room had only one key for two people which caused more problems when my partner returned. I was quite late and stressed for my meeting. It was  frustrating to have to send messages to Montreal for issues in Boston.
Parking at the lot they suggested was $98 for my two nights."

The outside porch was stacked to the ceiling with boxes and even an old mattress and we had to walk through a path to get to the door to the house.  The place was very small, especially the bedrooms, and old with no updated anything at all; no real doors on the bedrooms; they have accordian heavy plastic doors so privacy is limited.  The bathroom we had to use was shared by everyone including the owners.  Cat little box was next to toilet, bathroom was very old and not kept up, grime all around tub, all around dirty feeling.  Their house cat was allowed in guest rooms, even if we did not want it to.  Overall an uncomfortable stay. "
273,-2,House is very mess. Cat's Litter box is right beside bath room toilet. I can smell the litter box in the room I stay. It is very difficult to get a street parking. I mush have Sally and Bruce to help me park my car in their narrow and 30 degree up hill parking lot.  I have a very unpleasant experience and won't recommend to anyone. 
274,-1,"The host was nice, but I would not stay here again.  I stayed here for 5 days - and there was no wifi which was massively frustrating.  There was no blow dryer (which was listed on the page).  The space was very dark and very small.  However, the location was great!  "
275,-1,"we met at the corner of his street to find the address together - we had talked on the telephone before. everything went smooth, although it was a bit cold & windy... not Evan's fault (smiley).

276,-1,"Wir hatten sechs sehr schöne Tage in Boston bei Claudia und Isaac. 
Das Zimmer ist sauber und schön hell und das Bett ist sehr gemütlich.
Claudia und Isaac sind sehr rücksichtsvoll und wir haben nur wenig von ihnen mitbekommen.
Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen!
"
277,-4,"our FIRST use of Airbnb. When we arrived Hermina wasn't there and another guest opened the door for us. when I called her she told me that our room is in the basement and told me where I can find the key. But I couldn't find it because previous guests hadn't leaved yet!! After they left we went to the room, it was messy and DIRTY. WE had to changed the bed sheets ourselves! We didn't expect it at all! The bathroom was so DIRTY, the trashcan was full and the carpet was wet and gross  and smelled awful!
the advantages of this house was that it is so near to the RED line subway station. 
All in all, it was my LAST use of Airnbb!
"
278,-1,"Hermina, was just extremely nice I didn't really get a chance to enjoy her house or company since I had a long airport delay but she opened her house no problem at 3 in the morning and never seemed angry I arrived so late. A MUST if u are going to Boston choose herminas's house"
279,-2,I came in to Boston late after leaving Greenland on Air Iceland and Iceland on Iceland express.  I was concerned about disturbing the other guest & Hermina placed me in a large room in the basement where I was unnoticed by the other guest.  Hermina is a lovely host.
280,-1,"Hermina is nice, friendly and generous  but she didn't tell us that the room was  in the basement. The room is big but  is humid and smells humid. It is dark because there is only a small window. When we arrived we could not understand if the bed sheets were used or not. In the room there isn't any wardrobe where put or  hung clothes. The room , and the house in general is not clean. We had bugs in the room. Bathroom in the basement is small and not clean. Dorchester is not a nice suburb, but the house is very close to subway. We would NOT come back. "
281,-1,"Parfait en tout point ! Maison bien conçue, bien équipée, très grande chambre, propre, hôte agréable et attentif. Je recommande absolument !"
282,-2,"We got room C which was not suitabele for 4 persons. It is under the roof top. One bed-leg of the futon was broken and the matress sags.
When we arrived it was only prepared for three persons. But this problem could be solved with some telephon calls.
"
283,-2,"Uncomfortable, rooms are like cheap hostel. Very cold in rooms. House is located in korean/vietnamiese district. Only 1 parking place for 4 rooms."
284,-1,"Zu dritt schliefen wir für drei Nächte im sehr gemütlich eingerichteten und klimatisierten Keller des Hauses. Die nächste Metrostation (Red Line) ist 5 Minuten entfernt und man erreicht damit die Park Street in ungefähr 15 Minuten. In der Nähe vom Haus gibt es mehrere Einkaufsläden, Bars und Fressbuden.

Ich würde aufjedenfall nochmal bei Hermina übernachten, falls ich Boston wieder besuche."
285,-1,Trotz meiner sehr späten Ankunft war die Schlüsselübergabe für Tiffany und ihr Team kein Problem. Sie halfen mir während meines Aufenthalts mit unterschiedlichen Informationen und Tipps. Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben. Die Lage in Beacon Hill ist einfach großartig.
286,-1,"Wir konnten das Appartment nach Caitlins und Dans Beschreibung problemlos finden und auch hinein kommen. Das Appartment ist sehr schön und hat auch eine eigene Terrasse, was beim Frühstück toll ist. Die Lage ist auch nahe an der Ubahn, was gut ist, auch wenn abends die Gegend um den Bahnhof etwas dunkel ist. Wir haben die Gastgeber leider während unseres Aufenthaltes nie gesehen, aber hätten sie über Telefon und Email jederzeit erreichen können."
287,-1,"Nous n'avons pas rencontré nos hôtes durant notre séjour mais le nécessaire avait été fait pour que nous prenions possession du logement.
Seuls petits bémols : nous aurions apprécié un réfrigérateur avec une partie freezer car nous avions une glacière avec des freeze-packs que nous n'avons pas pu re-congeler compte tenu du fait que nous n'avons pas pu rencontrer nos hôtes. L'équipement du studio est un tout petit peu juste en vaisselle et il manquait un torchon pour l'essuyer... 
Rien de bien grave en tout état de cause.
Une suggestion cependant, et compte tenu de l'exiguïté du logement et de la présence d'une grande terrasse : la présence d'une table un peu plus grande et de chaises confortables sur ladite terrasse serait un vrai plus."
288,-1,"everything in that place is perfect. only one problem: there is no parking,and the parking lots  are not cheap."
289,-3,"While the general location in north Boston is great, the unit is a dive.  To reach the unit you go down metal stairs that haven’t been painted for who knows how many years and around a series of pipes to a door kindly described as uninviting.  The dungeon like low ceiling two bedroom unit looks to have been fitted into an old storage area or boiler room.  It does not resemble the photo in the listing.  The bottom of the windows is inches above the pavement and junk in an alley.  You can’t open a window as there’s no telling what alley roaming critter may jump in.  The uneven floor gives everyone an opportunity to trip and fall.  The peeling paint bathroom doesn’t even have a toilet paper holder.  The bathroom door casing is rotting at the bottom and passing the rot onto the door.  The shower has black mold like stains throughout the caulked corners.  The kitchen features an eclectic mix of cups, glasses, plates, pots and pans however no wine glasses.  There is no exhaust fan above the gas range.  The TV looked like it was bought second hand twenty years ago.  The bedrooms were interesting.  One with no closet, a chair for an end table and duct tape to keep the window together.  The other with a tiny unfinished closest..  While the cleaners did what they could the place was still a dive.  I have the photos."
290,-2,"Well, talking about host- he was extremely rude, arrogant and never made us feel good in the property. And when I say that rest all things become Secondary.
Sharing just one of the Incidents that happened. 
We were suppose to reach there at about 11 AM as the Host had given us the permission for Early Check-in; and that was very kind of him.
Apart from that nothing was good about the stay experience, as our flight got delayed and we got late so I called the host at 1 PM and told him that we will reach by 5-5.30 PM. Now after that unfortunately, we forgot the time and realised that we are late only after we received a call from the Host at 6.30 PM. 
The Host at first sounded genuine as he told us that he was waiting for us but then he said that if we are to stay in the Property we have to reach there by 7 PM as after that he will be leaving and he has Job to do.
We realised our mistake and reached there by the given time and felt Sorry to the host a number of times but it was very late that we realised that he also stayed in the same property. So, now here are my points-
1. We only called him and told him about our arrival timings twice, but he never told us prior that he is particular about Check-in timings.He has not even mentioned that in his Rules.
2. He got our shoes removed outside; again that should be mentioned in the House Rules.
3. 1 day before our Check-out time, he asked what time we will be leaving and I replied, ""Around 11 AM""; to which he said, ""It's fine and as long as you understand that"". This was even more ridiculous for him to say anything like that.
4. Lastly, even after a number of Sorry feelings he made us realise as we did some big crime.
Also the Room size is not that big as it appears in the pictures, even though there is just adequate storage space available with it.
Neighbourhood is good without any issues with good it and close to Restaurants and Grocery stores."
291,-1,"This was my first time to Boston and the only negative I can find is the host. The advertisement is a lie as the only available area for you is the front bedroom. Communication was poor from the beginning as he did not respond to my message for more than a week till we were a hour outside of the city the day we came. The host was incredibly rude in the sense that he did not make us feel welcome, and continued to criminalize us. At one point he accused us of using his second bathroom, and in the morning was angry with me when my friend knocked on his door, a half an hour prior to check out to come get me. I apologized that my phone was dead, but this continued to make him be incredibly inconsiderate. 

Pros: 

Cheap
Nice neighborhood

Cons:

Rude and unwelcoming host. 
All that is for rent is the small bedroom and the bathroom. Don't go to the living room and don't to go on the balcony. 
Provide your own towels and bath supplies. As the host will make you feel like you're overstepping you're single room boundary for using them. Or my personal favorite, try to take the provided bar of soap and put it in his bathroom to say you were in there.

L'appartement dans son ensemble est tres beau et la vue sur le port le rend encore plus charmant. Nous n'avons pas utilise la cuisine mais par choix! Mais Andrew nous a fait sentir chez nous en nous autorisant à utiliser tout ce dont nous avions besoin. Nous avons peu rencontre Andrew car il était souvent absent. Le logement est dans le quartier hispanique, si vous aimez manger mexicain et autres, foncez!"
293,-1,"it's nice,near to subway,near to city parking is not a problem. all the people are very nice. although I don't know why I couldn't get the window closed,so it's kind noisy."
294,-1,"Das Zimmer ist Teil einer Wohnung mit mehreren vermieteten Zimmern. Es handelt sich um ein recht großes und  gut eingerichtetes Zimmer. Alles ist gut organisiert, es ist kein Problem an den Schlüssel zu kommen. Sauberkeit und Ordnung in Küche und Bad waren jedoch grenzwertig wie in einer WG, die den Putzplan nocht nicht geklärt hat. Die Lage ist gut, zur U-bahn ist es wie beschrieben sehr nah, die Stadtmitte kann in 15 Minuten erreicht werden. Allerdings liegt das Zimmer an einer recht lauten Straße. Parken vor der Haustür war kein Problem. Das Viertel ist eher ärmlich, aber irgendwie sympathisch. "
295,-2,"The room was as pictured on Airbnb but there was also a comfortable chair and a refrigerator freezer in my room. The bed was very comfortable and there was lots of space to hang and store clothing. I appreciated that the house was only two blocks from the Orient Heights metro and that I was able to get a room with one days notice because my arrangements fell through at the last minute.

There were two bathrooms and one shower which were shared with five rooms of people which made it occasionally challenging to take a shower. I only received one towel to shower with and I couldn't locate anyone on premises to get another one.  The bedding and the refrigerator was spotless but there were hordes of dust balls all over the floor which aggravated my allergies.  It's a tossup if I would stay there again even though it was only $70 a night."
296,-1,"The neighborhood is ok, really convenient since there is direct access to the subway system.
Be aware that this is basically a hotel. Restrooms, kitchen and showers are shared and quite dirty, but since the location is so convenient that might not be a showstopper. Also the beds are really unstable.
"
297,-3,"The location was great,it's 10 min to the T-train and 10 more min to the center of the city.
That's the only good thing I can say! Unfortunately the whole house is totally dirty,almost to dirty to live inside! The bathtub is not usable because it's so dirty and the shower is ok.. But still outside the shower is everything covered with dust and hairs. I'm sry to say that but the whole house is disgusting!! 
We planned to cook while we stay there but after we saw the kitchen we decided to go out to eat..
I'm very disappointed!"
298,-3,"Unfortunately our stay wasn't as good as we expected, mainly because the building, in general, wasn't clean. I'm not that person who is addicted to cleanliness, but in this case the place was truly dirty. You know when we clean only superficially... and under the bed, behind the furniture, the windows, they are all dirty? It happens with me sometimes in my room, but it's my place... (:P) When the place is to receive guests it must be very clean, all clean!
The kitchen was completely dirty... the cooker was covered by food scraps... The common area was very unclean, with dust everywhere... and a lot of cigarette butts... Our room and the bathroom were, as I said, only slightly clean.

Other thing that bothered us a bit was that we arrived at 4pm, the time when the check-in started, but there was no one to receive us... The person who knew where the keys of our room were arrived only 1 hour later.

On the other hand, the location was good, near the subway station.
And the fridge inside the room really helped us, since using the kitchen wasn't a viable option.
"
299,-1,Communicatie is goed en uitgebreid. Locatie en appartement meer geschikt voor zakelijk gebruik dan prive vakantie. Uitzicht rondom parkeerplaatsen. Appartement is sober ingericht veel spullen van eigenaar aanwezig. Voorzieningen zoals borden en glazen en handdoeken beperkt. 
300,-1,Perfect location for exploring Boston!Two disappointing things about our stay:  Wi-fi connection was horrible.  Bummed that we had to spend $84 for parking that was nowhere close to our accommodations. Why not purchase a resident parking permit that can be given to visitors so that they can park in the neighborhood during their stay and returned to you when they leave?
301,-1,"Très bel appartement. Cela correspondait parfaitement à la description. Tout s'est bien passé. Facile d'accès et confortable.
L'hôte a été très efficace pour répondre à une de mes demandes.
Je recommande l'endroit et l'hôte."
302,-1,"La maison était tout simplement parfaite et nous avons passé un très beau séjour (trop court!). C'était très propre, accueillant et chaleureux. Nous avions l'impression d'être choyés de vivre dans une telle maison pour quelques jours.

Les lits sont confortables, la cuisine et les salles de bain sont fonctionnelles, la petite cour arrière est très agréable. Nous avons eu l'occasion d'aller marcher dans le quartier et c'était vraiment plaisant. Il y a un parc tout près, la plage n'est pas loin non plus et l'arrêt d'autobus est juste en face de la maison. La station de métro n'est pas très loin (environ 15 minutes). C'est un très beau quartier, on s'y sentait comme chez nous.

Il est certain que nous retournerons chez James lorsque nous irons dans le coin de Boston, nous n'aurions pas pu trouver mieux. Nous avons même été accueillis en français par une amie du propriétaire, très gentille."
303,-1,"Je recommande chaudement la famille Carney!!! Leur maison est situé dans un  magnifique quartier résidentiel à 5 min du métro donc très facile pour rejoindre le centre ville. Pour ce qui est de la chambre tout est parfait : literie, calme, confort (chaussons, peignoirs, 5 grandes serviettes par personnes ^^, vous ne manquerez de rien!). Il y a 2 salles de bains donc ce n'est jamais encombré. Pour finir, le petit dej est très complet avec des choses pour tous les gouts! Mary et son mari ont été aux petits soins et d'une hospitalité rare, si vous devez passer un séjour à Boston n'hésitez pas une seconde!"
304,-1,"La demeure est très agréable, les chambres sont coquettes, les salles de bains spacieuses et propres. Le quartier très agréable et résidentiel. La station de métro : ""Saving Hill"" se trouve à 5 minutes à pieds, ce qui est vraiment pratique pour rejoindre le centre de Boston. On regrette juste la voie rapide qui est un peu bruyante la nuit et la climatisation qui a été mise lors de notre dernière nuit, mais qui s'est révélé plus bruyante que le trafic routier. Par contre, un petit conseil ne vous stationnez surtout pas dans le drive way devant la maison qui est également emprunté par la voisine, ce qui vous évitera les remontrances de tout le monde. Ce n'est pas du tout agréable d'assister aux querelles du voisinage et de se sentir fautifs par la suite. Ceci dit, j'ai conseillé au propriétaire de barrer ce passage afin que les clients ne se méprennent plus... chose qui a été faite lors de notre séjour. Autrement, le petit-déjeuner et les muffins aux bleuets étaient délicieux. "
305,-1,"A experiência com a Carney Family foi excelente! O casal é extremamente agradável e nos fez sentir em casa! A residência é muito bem arrumada, limpa e possuí uma vista maravilhosa para o mar, onde tive a oportunidade de ver o melhor nascer do sol de minha vida! Fui muito bem recebido e instruído sobre as acomodações, bem como o local para estacionar meu veículo. Necessitei utilizar o telefone para ligação local e prontamente fui autorizado pelos anfitriões sem custo algum. Simplesmente fantástica a hospedagem! Quando voltar a Boston, com certeza me hospedarei na residência..."
306,-1,"Uns hat der Aufenthalt bei der Carney Family sehr gut gefallen. Die Anbindung nach Downtown Boston ist gut und die Nachbarschaft mit seinen bunten Villen sehr schön. Unser Zimmer und die Toilletten waren in einem sehr guten Zustand und die Gastgeber sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Besonders toll sind auch die morgendlichen Muffins und all die anderen kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten, die den Gästen zur Verfügung stehen."
307,-1,"Un très bon endroit situé pas loin de Boston. La chambre est agréable. La maison est grande et bien aménagé pour le Airbnb. Les chambres et les 2 salles de bains ont surement été rénové il n'y a pas longtemps donc tout est vraiment très propre. Le petit déjeuner est vraiment top avec des muffins maison le matin! 
Le métro est à 10 min même pas à pied donc c'est parfait pour aller visiter Boston.

Je recommande sans hésitation!"
308,-1,"Chez Mary et Barney on est réveillé par l'odeur des muffins tout chauds sortis du four. L'emplacement est parfait, très beau quartier proche de la ligne rouge. La maison est splendide, Mary et Barney sont des hôtes chaleureux et attentifs. Les chambres sont très belles, les salles de bains étincelantes avec une très belle vue sur la marina. Tout est étudié dans les moindres détails pour le confort et la sérénité des voyageurs, on se sent chez soi dès le seuil passé. Une très belle cuisine où on peut se préparer son dîner quand on ne souhaite pas sortir. Et le parfum des muffins fraîchement préparés par Barney, aux saveurs différentes chaque jour suffit à vous persuader de revenir. Aucune hésitation, c'est notre maison à Boston."
309,-1,"Nous n'avons jamais rencontré Carols. Les chambres louées sont au sous-sol d'une maison, ce qui implique beaucoup d'humidité, de bruit, d'insectes et de mauvaises odeurs. La cuisine, n'est pas du tout bien équipée (1 casserole et 1 poêle, pour 4 chambres potentiellement louables). La chambre est petite et peu aérée (on ne peut pas ouvrir en grand la seule et unique petite fenêtre de la chambre). La propreté et l'état général des surfaces communes sont déplorables (couloir, cuisine, salle de bain). 
Cependant, le quartier est typique de la banlieue de Boston, ce qui nous a plu. Facile d'accès au centre avec la red line qui passe à environ 10min de la maison. 
Cette location est notre pire séjour avec airbnb. De plus, le dernier jour de notre séjour, nous avons demandé gentiment à Carols si nous pouvions laisser nos gros sacs à dos dans la chambre ou dans la maison, pour une durée minime de 3h. Malheureusement, selon elle, nous devions payer un supplément de 20$ pour cette demande. Par principe, et considérant l'état de l'appartement, nous avons refusé. 
En conclusion, nous trouvons que cette location va à l'encontre de l'esprit d'airbnb. VIVEMENT DECONSEILLE!"
310,-1,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour chez Ann et Mike. 
Leur maison est parfaite. Il y a absolument tout. Dans un style typique 'vieille Angleterre'. Dans un quartier très typique et charmant avec ses maisons en bois peintes. Et extrêmement calme. Mais avec le métro et le bus très accessibles donc on se peut se rendre Down Town très facilement. 
Heather a été extrêmement disponible. Tout le temps. Et très rapide dans ses réponses. 
Au global, c'était vraiment parfait. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir. "
311,-2,"The studio is so below average and very expensive for what it offers! For the same money per night you can stay at a hotel and enjoy safety and cleanliness!
-The building is old, with dirty walls and stuff around, and weird people get in and out
-The neighbourhood is not one of the good places to stay in Boston. If you are girls only, or a family it is not safe
-The apartment looked clean but you could not realise if the towels in the bathroom were clean or the bed. It didn't t have that smell of clean clothes. There were also things used in the house, and even in the bathroom that made you feel bad
-There were expired foods in the fridge (the owner suggests that we throw them away but when you see an expired milk like 10 days and it is not yours yoy dont wanna touch it)
-It is impossible to open the windows, as it is either unsafe or very noisy"

Room very narrow for 3 people to stay. 
Common areas, lounge, bathroom and kitchen was dirty and messy. There was no communication with host.
The beds were dirty and very uncomfortable"

317,-2,"Nous avons eu un magnifique séjour chez Meghan, qui nous a fait quelques suggestions pour visiter la ville à notre arrivée.  La chambre et le logement en général étaient très propres et joliment décorés. Nous avons peu exploré l'environnement immédiat, mais avons tout de même bien apprécié l'architecture et un bon petit café/boulangerie au coin de la rue. La distance de marche pour atteindre le métro est plutôt courte et le trajet vers le centre-ville se fait très facilement."
318,-1,"Nous avons passé trois jours à Boston chez Meghan, qui a été une hôte d'une extrême gentillesse. Elle a eu différentes attentions à notre égard, a répondu à nos questions et nous a indiqué  des bons plans dans la ville.
Son appartement est très chaleureux, le lit tres confortable, et le tout est tres bien placé dans le quartier de Jamaica Plain, à quelques minutes de métro du centre ville.
Son chien est également un amour.
Nous retournerons chez Meghan sans hésitation lors d'un prochain voyage dans cette ville.

319,-1,"Malheureusement je n'ai vu Meghan qu'une fois, le lendemain de mon arrivée donc l'échange fut bref mais sympathique, deplus week-end du 4 juillet. Mais j'ai eu la compagnie de Wally.

Cependant, nous avons souvent communiqué par messages interposés, Meghan fut très réactive.

La chambre est simple et propre, le plus est la porte qui donne un accès privé à sa chambre mais en contre partie cela ne donne pas l'impression d'etre chez quelqu'un et facilité un éventuel échange avec la personne qui accueil.

Le quartier : au début je trouvais cela logement un peu loin du T mais en fait pas du tout, c'est meme très pratique la ligne Orange est très centrale et rapide.

Café : Canto 6, très bien et très bon pour commencé la journée. J'ai trouvé les viennoiseries un peu cher tout de même mais bon quand on vient de France forcement on est plus difficile...

L'accès à la chambre est très bien, nous avions notre porte accédant à notre chambre. Il a fait très chaud lors de notre weekend à Boston et l'air climatisé et le ventilateur dans la chambre étaient parfaits et nous étions très confortables. Petit moins, le matelas a un creux dans le milieu et nous avions l'impression de glisser vers le centre,un peu moins agréable. Quelques déchets et saletés sous le lit comme un sac de plastique. Nous n'avions malheureusement plus de washclots à l'endroit où elle nous avait indiqué qu'il y a en avait. Drôle d'odeur dans l'appartement (nourriture à chien? couche à chien? l'humidité due à la chaleur accablante du weekend a probablement renforcé l'odeur dans tout l'appartement). 5 min à pied du métro , quartier sécuritaire. Communication facile avec l'hôte."
323,-3,"I am a woman in my 40s ,traveling for a business trip at the Hynes Convention Center. This place did not work out for me, due to the pungeant smell that triggered an allergic reaction (a combination of mothballs, deodorizers, and I'm not sure what else). I had to leave after a night, because it bothered me so much and I could not sleep. I also found the sex magnets on the fridge offensive. The place seemed like too much of a ""man cave"" for what I needed! "
324,-1,"We stayed in Ravi's apartment in July for two nights.
The apartment was ok and well located in Boston, but the bathroom was really small and old and there wasn't sink!!! 
When we arrived in we had to wait for Ravi around two hours to make the check in, and when we arrived at the apartment the airbed wasn't inflated."
325,-5,"Location, location, location is what this apartment has going for it. Unfortunately, for us, it was not enough.  The apartment is a quirky bachelor pad and probably would be fine for young, adventurous singles or couples, but for us 60-somethings, it was not a fit.  The building is old and the foyer smells musty.  The unit itself was clean, but shopworn, and there was an overwhelming odor of lemon-scented air freshener.  It is a studio, with a sleeping loft built above the kitchen area. The bathroom is a closet crammed with a toilet and shower. All washing has to be done in the kitchen sink. No stove, just a double hot plate. A small window air conditioner inadequately cools the room. When I went to close the front door, the doorknob came off in my hand.  (I repaired it using a table knife.) Even the location has its downside.  There is no parking in the area to speak of.  All parking on Beacon St. is reserved for residents.  There is metered parking on the side streets, but they revert to residents-only after 6:00 pm. Ravi had advised me of this earlier, but the holiday weekend and pending construction brought further parking restrictions in the area. The unit is advertised as four blocks from Fenway Park, but the blocks along Beacon are exceptionally long, and the ""four blocks"" add up to 1.2 miles according to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps.  We missed our appointment with Ravi thanks to a massive traffic jam, and he had to leave the keys for us, so we weren't able to do a walk-through with him.  Once we saw the unit, we didn't unpack.  We discussed the situation at the ballgame that evening and decided to cut our losses and move to a hotel. We did not sleep in the apartment.  I'm sure Ravi is a good guy, and his apartment is in a good neighborhood, but it's not for everyone, and should not be priced like a four-star hotel. "
326,-1,Had an last minute issue come up and had to cancel. Ravi was rest at working with me and coming up with a reasonable solution. Disappointed I didn't get to stay this trip but would definitely book again on future trips. 
327,-1,Quel endroit parfait! Nous avons eu l'impression de vivre comme de vrai Bostoniens. L'emplacement très près du T a grandement facilité nos déplacements et nous y reviendront lors de notre prochain passage à Boston. Terry est très accueillant et l'appartement était parfait sous tout point de vue. 
328,-1,Excellent accommodation and location for our family of 6 during son's graduation weekend from Northeastern. Close to orange line and a quick ride to anywhere in the city. Right off campus. Great restaurants in the area. No issues with TV or WiFi. Bed in the 3rd bedroom is not a trundle but our 6th person slept on the comfortable couch. Lots of extra linens and pillows available. Plenty of room to spread out and relax. Patio table looked great but we were unable to use it due to cold and rainy weekend. Stairs down to the unit were a bit difficult with a short handrail - only an issue for someone with limited mobility.
329,-1,"Although a map may give you an impression that the place is a bit far from the center of the city, it is not on the level of inconvenience. Once you get used to using the rails, you don't feel inconvenient."
330,-2,"Lisa was nice and welcoming. The room was almost clean despite a bad smell into it. But the bathroom was not clean at all. Many hairs in the toilet bowl, in the bath and the sink. The rest of the ap was also dirty : food under the living table, dust everywhere. Even if it is a shared apartment, we don't understand why it was that dirty, sorry. The location was good however, the bus passes just across, and the subway is only 2 bus stops."
331,-1,Nous sommes arrivé vers 22h30 et notre hôte nous a accueilli avec le sourire malgré qu'il était tard. Lisa a pris le temps de tout nous expliquer ce qu'on pouvait faire a Boston même si on passait seulement une nuit chez elle. Merci Lisa pour ton chaleureux accueil. 
332,-1,"Hermina was very helpful and went out of her way to assist us in anyway she could ,however the accommodation  was basic and lacked airconditioning  which we found tedious in the heat  ,the property is old and needs maintenance   "
333,-2,"Très bon séjour. Boston est une ville agréable. La maison est spacieuse et fonctionnelle avec tout ce qu il faut, même un lit bébé  . L environnement immédiat n'est pas terrible mais ce n'est pas ce que nous cherchions.
À recommander sans réserves 
"
334,-2,"Nous avons été surpris de découvrir qu'on partageait le logement avec d'autres invités, à moins d'avoir mal lu l'offre. Nous étions au sous-sol et une odeur de vieillissement ou d'humidité planait dans l'air. Heureusement que c'était juste pour dormir et préparer une cuisine rapide. On avait pas très bien compris si on pouvait consommer  les produits sur place à part le pain et les fruits où il était mentionné ""help yourself"" jusqu'à ce qu'une hôte nous le dise. Enfin la maison est propre à l'intérieur mais le quartier est sale, l'emplacement vraiment pas pas terrible. Le transport en commun n'est pas loin, un train dessert directement vers le centre de Boston. Si vous êtes délicats c'est un logement et un emplacement à éviter En conclusion très cher pour ce que c'est comparé au 2ème logement qu'on a loué sur Boston à peu de différence prêt.

335,-1,"Wir waren zwei Wochen in App#2. Die Ausstattung haben wir genau so vorgefunden wie beschrieben und auf den Fotos zu sehen. Die Lage ist optimal per Auto und per RedLine zu erreichen. Durch die Nachbarschaft der Polizeiwache haben wir uns sehr sicher gefühlt. Lärmbelästigung durch Sirenen gibt es eindeutig nicht. In dem Haus werden zwei App vermietet, wir waren mit Kind da, unsere wechselnden Nachbarn ebenso. Das Haus ist sehr hellhörig, wer mit Kindern und deren Geräuschen ein Problem hat, bleibt besser fern. Wer Kinder hat ist hier gut aufgehoben. An Spielzeug und Kinderausstattung denken - dies ist nicht beworben bzw. beschrieben und somit auch nicht vorhanden.
Das App. war sauber, die Bettwäsche und Handtücher hinreichend und frisch gewaschen vorhanden. Hermina stattet die Küche sogar mit Gewürzen, Pasta, Saucen etc. aus. Das Geschirr war mehr als hinreichend vorhanden und alles sehr sauber. Alle Elektrogeräte (Mikrowelle, Kaffeem., Fernseher, Fön...) haben einwandfrei funktioniert. Die Waschmaschine ist kostenpflichtig vorhanden, was wir auch gerne genutzt haben. Wifi ist ebenfalls funktionstüchtig vorhanden und hinreichend schnell für Mail/Surfen.

Hermina ist eine tolle, freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie hat sich von Ankunft bis Abreise um uns gekümmert und ist dabei stets diskret geblieben, was uns sehr gut gefallen hat.

Wir war insgesamt stets sehr zufrieden."
336,-1,"Hermina nous a fourni toutes les indications pour se rendre facilement à l'appartement, elle n'était pas là pour nous accueillir compte tenu de notre arrivée tardive mais nos l'avons vu le lendemain. L'appartement est propre et dispose de tout le nécessaire pour y vivre confortablement. Le quartier n'est pas le plus beau de Boston mais le métro est seulement à 5 min à pied pour vous rendre dans le centre de Boston en moins de 20 min. l'environnement est plutôt calme et sécurisant avec le poste de police à 10 mètres."
337,-1,Nous avons apprécié notre séjour. C'était tel que décrit. Chambre très propre. Tout était parfait. Les commodités aussi. Quartier sympathique. Nous retournerions au JP Green House.
338,-2,"Le logement est situé dans un quartier résidentiel, il faut compter 40 min de métro (arrêt à 15 min à pieds) pour rejoindre le centre de Boston. 
La chambre était propre. Les draps, serviettes et produits de base (non utilisés) étaient fournis (également sèche-cheveux, fer à repasser, plans de la ville). Andree fournit également de quoi prendre le petit déjeuner ; personnellement nous avons préféré le prendre à l'extérieur, la cafetière à piston n'était pas notre ""truc"".
En revanche, nous n'avons pas très bien dormi à cause du bruit (venant de la rue et de la maison) et de la lumière (le rideau n'est pas du tout occultant). De plus, le wifi, qui était un de nos critères de choix étant à l'étranger, était plus que capricieux.
Enfin, la chambre donne sur la cuisine ; or la double porte en bois ne ferme pas, rendant la chambre pas tout à fait ""private"". Mais nos hôtes se sont absentés le weekend ce qui a compensé.
Il y a possibilité de prendre le petit déjeuner dans la cuisine. 
Il est également très facile (et gratuit) de se garer dans la rue.
Nous n'avons pas croisé nos hôtes, mais ils semblaient disponibles et à l'écoute de par leurs mails.
"
339,-1,"The bathrooms are plentiful.  The view is breathtaking. The location is walking distance to famous parks and landmarks. The air conditioning was confusing. One room was freezing cold, and the rest of the house was hot and we finally figured it out in the morning. The elevators are slow and very small and the walk up is long but it is worth it. Every time someone uses the Elevator in the building you will know it by its hammering sound. craftsmanship of the apartment is bad. Stove burners doesn't lite. Missing windows blinds in all rooms and white paper blinds expect the awake up at 5am."
340,-5,"I would NEVER EVER book this place again!
Sure, for this price you can't expect much. So it's absolutely fair that the rooms furnishing was very basic and the place in general a bit worn. You'll hear the nearby I 93 in most of the rooms but since it's mostly just some background noise it's totally ok.
I could also life with the fact that there are several other people living in this place even though it can be annoying if you have to wait to get into the bathroom.
What I can't accept, though, is the dirty bathroom. It was obvious that it hadn't been cleaned for a LONG time: mold around the bathtub and the ceiling, piles of dust in the corners and urine and other stains on the toilet lid.
Right at our arrival (on Sunday) we brought this to our hosts attention. She replied that a cleaning person comes once a week (on Monday) and we should check again. When we came back Monday evening it was obvious that the cleaning person had been there since most of the 15+ shampoo bottles had been moved onto the shelf. But the bathroom wasn't any cleaner. 
Even a complaint to Airbnb didn't make any difference. 
Btw. everybody who saw our pictures of the bathroom was shocked."
341,-2,"Very clean and Central Place with walking distance to Airport Gates. Nevertheless no Noise from Planes. The host lives in the Basement and Virtually Assists At any Problem. However, currently there is a Building lot in the neighborhood which makes Long sleeping in the Morning impossible After 9am. The Walls Are also Quite thin."
342,-3,"Ricardo n'était pas présent lors de notre arrivée, mais il nous avait averti et nous n'avons pas eu de problème pour entrer. 

Pour la chambre, on ne peut pas dire que c'est le plus bel espace que nous ayons visité. Pour le prix que nous avons payé, nous nous attendions à mieux. Tout de même, puisque nous avions en tête de visiter la ville, nous avons profité amplement de ce weekend. Nous avions amené nos vélos et nous conseillons à tous les voyageurs de parcourir la ville de Boston de cette manière. 

Finalement, Ricardo a pensé à un système d'affichage pour le stationnement. C'est une bonne idée, seulement, quand nous avons voulu quitter, une voiture était garée devant la nôtre et personne n'avait laissé de coordonnées pour qu'on puisse le rejoindre. Il s'est avéré, après que nous ayons cogné à toutes les portes de l'auberge et dérangé les gens, que l'auto était celle du père de Ricardo... La moindre des choses serait donc que nos hôtes prennent l'habitude de suivre leurs propres règles!

Ceci dit, Boston est une ville charmante et le quartier de East Boston est rempli de restos et de pâtisseries latinos qu'il vaut la peine de visiter."
343,-1,"Les photos et la description de la maison de Margaret présents sur le site internet d’air bnb sont parfaitement conformes avec la réalité. La maison est très agréable et nous nous sommes sentis rapidement comme à la maison : quartier calme, sûr, rue commerçante et vivante à proximité, accès apprécié au jardin et à une grande terrasse. Cette partie de Boston est aérée et verte. L’accès au métro est facile (5 à 10 mn à pied) et la ligne de métro permet d’arriver dans le centre de Boston en 20 mn ensuite. Margaret est une hôte très sympathique et elle a répondu très rapidement avant notre arrivée à toutes nos questions. Elle a tout fait pour que nous nous sentions bien chez elle. Si nous devions revenir à Boston, nous choisirions à nouveau cette maison sans aucun doute !  "
344,-1,"Ricardo was very responsive in all of the questions that we asked him and was actively taking care of the common areas. The room was just as pictured; however, we did not anticipate the walls to be thin and the bathroom to be shared amongst at least 7 people, including ourselves. Additionally, the floor in the bedroom was creaky and uneven, and it tilted the bed, which made sleeping uncomfortable at times."
345,-2,"The apartment was in a great location near the airport and was really easy to get into. Made checking in and getting there really easy, especially when we were exhausted from jet lag. I would, however, pay special care to one of the amenities lacking in the list: air conditioning. We had an extremely hard time sleeping because of the heat, and because there was noisy construction going on starting at 6 AM in the morning right next door. "
346,-2,"L'appartement est plutot bien situé, a 10min de l'aéroport et deux pas de la ligne bleue qui mène au centre ville. Juste au bout de la rue, qui donne sur l'ocean, il y a un parc avec l'une des plus belles vues de boston au coucher du soleil.
Par contre la clim manque terriblement quand il fait 40degres dans la chambre, les murs ne sont pas très épais, les fenêtres et les rideaux non plus. Nous avons été réveillés à 7h tous les jours par les autres habitants, la lumière, la chaleur, les travaux, les voitures.
La chambre était assez spacieuse pour 2 personnes, l'accueil chaleureux, les deux cuisines bien équipées. Et rien à dire sur la propreté des lieux, c'était niquel et nettoyé tous les jours."

Il y a tout ce qui est nécessaire pour passer quelques jours."
348,-4,"Jason was very friendly and the location was mostly central to all areas. The unit itself was very small and lacking in basic necessities. A toaster, salt and pepper to begin with. There were not many dishes....
We fixed the squeaky doors and the second bedroom needed a mattress pad and dresser. 
Disappointed and way too pricey for what it was. Also, not the cleanest...Too many stairs. We had animal hair on socks and clothing.  Smelled odd "
349,-1,"Javier a été absolument parfait durant tout mon séjour, autant au niveau de l'accueil que durant les 13 jours que j'ai passés dans son appartement. L'appartement était absolument comme présenté sur les photos, particulièrement accueillant ce qui m'a fait me sentir comme chez moi."
350,-1,"Everything was fine.  Except that the map on Airbnb for the location
of the unit was incorrect.  That is probably Airbnb's fault. The map
indicated that the unit was located roughly on Commonwealth Avenue. I checked the address on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps and found where it
actually was.  That was no problem for me but it might be for others."
351,-2,"Jason was very welcoming, and the place was as described. The bedroom was kinda smallish compared to a hotel room but it beat paying exorbitant hotel rates downtown!"
352,-8,"I felt compelled to leave after two nights of a five night reservation.  The listing is NOT accurate.  The bed is a FULL not a queen and it CREAKS horribly.  The tiny attic bedroom is separated by a very long, narrow, steep set of stairs with very narrow treads from the bath which is directly off the kitchen.  I hardly slept at all the first night in this situation.  The second night, my husband went to a hotel and I stayed as I wanted to be near my daughter in JP whom I was there to visit.  This second night I slept in a state of utter exhaustion until 11 am the next morning.  The host made sarcastic comments about the late hour and urged me to eat outdoors, clearly indicating he did not want me in the kitchen.  Embarrassing.  Then he started calling me ""Maureen"" even though we had communicated plenty in previous days with my name, Meghan. Hostile?  Irritating.  Then there was the Blueberry Issue.  Mortifying.  He had provided fruit for breakfast, which I appreciated but never had requested, but apparently there were all sorts of rules about how much were to be eaten which he did not tell me until he reprimanded me!  So embarrassing.  I ate a whole box of blueberries and he informed me ""You are eating me out of house and home.  I can't buy a box of blueberries each day for you!""  I never asked him to, never expected him to and was completely mortified to be reprimanded for being a glutton.  Then they started to fry things in the kitchen and the strong cooking smells wafted up the narrow staircase and saturated my clothes.  yuck.  I usually get along with people but this host is definitely a prickly one with all sorts of rules that he doesn't advertise until he lashes out at you.  Beware!"
353,-3,"My sister and I ( 30) stayed with our elderly parents for 6 nights here (aged 70 & 69). The suburb was quiet and there was a pond close-by. The train station is not too far but the train takes about 30 minutes to down town. We were located on the third floor of the family home and shared their entrance.  If you want your own space i'd suggest renting an apt in the area which we found out later cost the same. If you are working then this area is probably fine but for tourists would suggest some where more central like Back Bay or downtown. Kelly was pleasant and allowed us to make a local call which we appreciated. Unfortunately one incident at the end impacted our experience. We made a mistake with the check out time and thought it was 3pm. We were finalizing our packing when the cleaners came into the house. The host (Phil) came back shortly after and I was disappointed the way he spoke to my elderly parents in a very inappropriate and disrespectful manner. My dad was upset after the encounter . It was a genuine misunderstanding. We hadn't discussed check out times with them (they were away the day before we were due to leave) and were unaware cleaners were due to arrive. At no time was this clarified by the hosts and as soon as we realised, we got out of their way and brought our luggage to the front door immediately. I privately emailed Phil on 27-9-2014 to convey my disappointment at his behaviour to try to resolve this in a cordial manner but never received a reply. (excerpt from email: I do want to express my disappointment at the way the matter was handled. My parents had not booked the bnb and were relying on us for all information. My father was upset after his exchange with Phil on Friday evening, which was rude and unwarranted against my elderly father who was taking all direction from us on the holiday.)The following day I received notification that he had left a review on this site. An apology would have sufficed. "
354,-1,Notre arrivée le soir chez Kelly Campbell s'est bien passée. Nos hôtes se sont montrés disponibles et nous ont indiqué immédiatement où nous restaurer. L'appartement au 2ème  étage d'un grande maison bourgeoise située dans un quartier très agréable correspondait tout à fait aux photos et à la description qui en est faite. Nous avons aussi apprécié la proximité avec une rue où se trouvent plusieurs bons restaurants.  
355,-2,"Wir waren drei Nächte in Boston und die Unterkunft hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Es ist alles genau so, wie im Inserat und den Bildern dargestellt. Insbesondere die Nachbarschaft mit tollen Holzhäusern ist klasse; nur 5 Minuten zur T und dann in 20 Minuten ins Zentrum, klappt sehr gut. 
Die Wohnung heizt sich allerdings ganz schön auf, es gibt zwar air condition aber die ist nicht superleise. Aber das haben wir gerne in Kauf genommen. Die Gastgeber haben wir leider gar nicht getroffen, sie waren in der Zeit auch teilweise unterwegs. Dies war aber kein Problem, hat alles problemlos geklappt. Und zur Begüßung standen sogar einige Sachen im Kühlschrank, sehr nett. Jamaica Plain ist wirklich schön, unbedingt einmal in den Nebenstrassen rumlaufen. Gerne wieder."
356,-1,"L appartement est bien situé, juste à l arrêt du bus numéro 11 qui nous emmène en 20 minutes au centre ville. Le quartier est calme et la maison est magnifique et très fonctionnelle. Tout est neuf et très propre. Les photos publiées correspondent à la réalité.

L'appartement est très propre, bien équipé, bien décoré avec une belle terrasse. Le métro est à 20mn de marche mais un arrêt de bus est directement dans la rue. 
Meri donne absolument tout ce qu'il y a à savoir sur les fonctionnalités de l'appartement, des environs et de Boston en général, ce qui simplifie notre adaptation à l'arrivée!
Excellent appartement et service de la part de Meri! "
358,-1,"Monroe and Mary were AMAZING! Monroe was very prompt answering my emails and gave us amazing directions to their place. We arrived late on Thursday and they stayed up to make sure that we got in safely.
We arrived late because I gave wrong directions to my Lyft driver. Make sure you put Drive not Street. I made that mistake many times this weekend. 

 They had coffee and juice for us in the morning and they gave us rides to the train station since it was a thirty minute walk!

My only regret is that we didn't get a chance to hang out with them more.  If I come back to Boston, and I will,  I plan on staying with them again!"
359,-1,"Nous avons réservé moins de 12 heures à l’avance et Jessica nous a répondu très rapidement! Le « Garden apartment »  était tel que décrit. Bien situé, car près du métro (subway). On pouvait laisser notre voiture dans la rue, sans restriction de stationnement. Jessica nous a très bien accueillis. Elle nous a parlé d’endroits à visiter à Boston et des services près de sa maison. Nous lui avons laissé des billets pour le Museum of Fine Arts et elle nous a proposé des billets pour le Zoo en échange. Un bel endroit calme pour passer quelques jours!"

Das Zimmer ist gross, hell und gemütlich. Das Haus liegt sehr nahe an der U-Bahn-Station, nach downtown ist es dann nur ca. 20min."
363,-2,"Grosses, gemütliches Zimmer mit riesigem Fernseher und viel Schrank-Platz. Der Gastgeber ist zuvorkommend und immer gut drauf. Allerdings muss man sich der Distanz zur Stadt doch bewusst sein, wir haben 40min zu Fuss gebraucht. Metro sollte allerdings kein Problem sein. Das Bad wird mit dem Rest der Gäste geteilt, wird aber sauber gehalten."
364,-2,We stayed here for 12 days in August. The place was generally comfortable and well-located (~10 mins walk from three different T lines). We had some problems with amenities when we first moved in (bathtub wouldn't drain and stove wasn't working) which for various reasons took several days to fix. However Kama offered us compensation  in the form of a partial refund. I suspect that these problems are unlikely to arise again now that they've been dealt with.
365,-2,"    Unfortunately our stay was not what we had hoped. The apt was fine, but the air conditioner did not work for the 2 nights we were there. It was very hot and stuffy, and opening the windows was not an option due to the significant street noise. We contacted Will numerous times, but there was no attempt to help out with something like a fan (since fixing it was not in the cards).  Will acknowledged that this had been an issue in the past, but obviously had not been fixed. It was really uncomfortable.
    There was no soap for the shower, which is really a nit picky thing to say. Not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to know that you are supposed to bring your own before we arrived.
    Street noise was an issue - especially if you are a light sleeper, There is also a crying baby in the next apartment (whose bedroom shares a wall with this apartment bedroom), so there is random crying at times of the day/night.  
    We were disappointed and it would be hard to recommend staying there"
366,-3,"Except for the location, an overall disappointing experience. The  apartment is older and in worse condition than the description and photos seem to show. Note that it's on a 3rd floor with no lift, there's no TV, internet is available through a weak Mifi device, it's very noisy outside (ie. provided earplugs!), etc. "
367,-6,"We had rented another apartment from Will last December so we knew the building and the area. It was perfect for our visit to see our new Grandson. Unfortunately the unit we rented on our last visit was not available so we had to go with a different one on a higher floor. The stairs, all thought not our first choice, we're not an issue for us. The bedroom in the apartment was very small. The bed was up to the wall on one side but quite comfortable. The living area was large enough but with very limited TV stations. The bathroom was so small and the layout so bad that my husband had to step into the shower to close the door to get to the sink. We knew going in that the unit was small, but for our short stay and the perfect location  we were willing to sacrifice the space. 
Unfortunately, Will , you need to get a new cleaning person. The floor in the kitchen was sticky. There was dust and crumbs within sight under the refrigerator. The refrigerator had dried spilled smelly something on the back of the top shelf and crumbs stuck in between the shelf and the refrigerator wall. There also was a bag of chicken nuggets in the freezer. The counters had dried crumbs and sticky bits on them that only took a little scrubbing by me to get them off. And the worst was that the sink smelled like rotting food. We figured out that it was coming from the garbage disposal. We ran lots of hot water (once we figured out how to turn the hot water heater on) into the disposal and then put dish soap in it till it filled up. Put the plug in and let it set all night, then ran more hot water while running the disposal. It was better but we still could smell it. The floor under the sink in the bathroom was dirty too. 
Unfortunately we don't think we will stay there again.
"
368,-6,"
Our stay here was a nightmare. We’ve stayed at numerous AirBnb’s in 5 different countries and have never had a bad experience.  Until now. 
 
The host was rude, inappropriate, and had no respect for privacy.  Also, this is listed as an “Entire Place”; it’s not.   It’s a room in this woman’s house.  

My husband and I were in Boston for business.  Our first night was without incident.  The host seemed friendly, if a bit eccentric. 
 
On our second night, we came back to the house after a long day at a conference.  It had been pouring rain all day.  We were exhausted and eager to get out of our damp clothes and go to bed.

While taking off our wet shoes at the door, we were accosted by the host, who demanded to know why we hadn’t answered her texts (my phone was on silent from the conference).   She was incensed that I hadn’t responded immediately. 
 
Apparently there was some sort of leak downstairs in our room.  She discovered this while entering our space while we were out.  We’re not sure why she was in there, but we didn’t know she would be doing so and it invaded our privacy.

She was babbling incoherently about the leak for 30 minutes; we were unsure what was happening.  

She then became very domineering, making me carry bedding downstairs and ordering my husband to fix the bed that she had haphazardly propped up on a powerdrill (not sure why she had done this).  In the midst of this, she starts yelling at me about my slightly damp socks.  I wanted nothing more than to take off my damp clothes but she’d started ordering us around before I had a chance.  

She was so abusive that my husband finally spoke up, saying he didn’t appreciate how she was speaking to us, to which she responded, “If you want concierge service you should stay at a hotel”. 
 
She was incredibly rude and acted as though the leak and ensuing chaos was our fault.  We felt uncomfortable and considered leaving immediately, but we weren’t sure how to find another place at that late hour. 
 
Early the next morning, my phone rang while we were sleeping. I groggily answered the phone to the host aggressively demanding access to the room.  Before I could respond, she rudely hung up.

We immediately gathered our things and left without brushing our teeth.  Our bus didn’t leave until 5pm, so we were forced to carry our luggage around Boston in the pouring rain because we felt so unwelcomed in her home. 
 
Stay here at your own risk.  Based on other reviews, it sounds like she can put on a veneer of kindness.  But if something goes wrong, be prepared to be verbally attacked and harassed.

Also, we LOVE dogs, but this dog – while adorable – isn't well trained.  It kept jumping on us (it’s a big dog!) and twice barged into our room to try and eat our pizza. "
369,-17,"This house was listed as entire home/apartment. This is a downright lie. This should be listed as a private room. We purposely NEVER choose any option but entire apartment to avoid the risk of staying with a ""host"" such as this.

Now onto whether Veronika made us feel welcome:  I experienced problems with the toilet flushing initially. Later on that night my wife experienced the same problem and this time the toilet overflowed. Without a plunger in the bathroom, we were left relatively helpless. Veronika's response was to scream and shout, how could this happen and why we didn't use the plunger ""stored away elsewhere"" she went to another room to retrieve the plunger.  I would imagine the bathroom is a good place for a plunger and if she feel that it is not, she shouldn't complain when people can't find her hiding place for it. THERE WAS NO PLUNGER IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY!!!

And just a side note on this - toilets sometimes overflow, IT HAPPENS! It’s no one’s fault! If you want to have guests in your house, then THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH UNFORTUNATELY!!! 

On a side note the room which is in the basement is not connected to the toilet at all which happens to be upstairs next to the kitchen.

After the bathroom flooded and the water stopped gushing out, she INSISTED that we clean and scrub the toilet flaws. Again, she shouldn't have even been there, but besides this, it is deplorable for a host of any sort to act in this way. So we actually cleaned that entire toilet bathroom - it was spotless YES -  WE CLEANED IT ALL UP OURSELVES ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES!

We offered to have the mats cleaned to which she refused. She later made a claim for $150 from us.

The following day we forgot the key at the house so when we got home later that evening (it was around 22:30) we had to call her to open, and she was SO rude, she had this terrible expression on her face, didn't say hello/good evening (I mean this happens sometimes its no big deal again!!!) and she says QUOTE ""First the toilet and now this, its not looking very good guys"" and then just turned away and walked upstairs. WHY SO RUDE!!??! so unnecessary and uncalled for.

The next NIGHT, she decided to kick us out of her apartment after she went through out rubbish. As we got in to the house she said very condescendingly QUOTE ""I left a present for you in the bathroom"" and when I went to look she had placed our TRASH (that we had left in the trashcan) IN THE SINK AND INSISTED WE TAKE IT - This was absolutely RIDICULOUS! WHO DOES THAT? I mean this kind of treatment is absolutely disgusting and abhorrent.

370,-1,"Nous avons merveilleusement été accueillis par Veronica. Elle sait vous mettre en confiance et très à l'aise. L'appartement est parfait, tel que décrit sur le site. Tout est harmonieusement agencé. Des touches très délicates et charmantes parsèment l'appartement. 
De plus il est très bien situé à quelques pas du métro permettant d'accéder facilement au centre de Boston.Un parking nous permet de laisser la voiture. 
Mais comment ne pas parler des SUBLIMES petits déjeuners concoctés par notre hôte."
371,-1,"Our host made us feel welcome. The neighborhood was great, easy access to Boston U and Whole Foods.  Two problems did surface -- the first night we had no heat so it was a really, really grim cold night. After consulting with our host the second and third nights had heat and were great. The second problem was one of the layout of the  apartment - great for two people, not so great for our three as the third person sleeping on the couch had to go through the bedroom to reach the bathroom."
372,-2,"Our family of 4 stayed with 2 adults, 2 kids stayed at the apt for 4 days in late March.   The apt has a promise and could be a great space.  We dislike having to give a negative review, but to be honest the negatives outweighed the positives. 
The positives: 
- good layout with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, living room for space 
- the host was readily available to answer questions and resolve issues 
- the ""T"" stop subway and mass transit is quite literally acrosss the street and extremely convenient to downtown, colleges or airport 
- uber drivers nearby because of the subway
- Wifi and cable tv are excellent  
- new towels

The negatives:
-  The cleaning service clearly did not have their best day as we found dirty dishes in the dishwasher, some dirty clothes in dressers, and a bathroom tub that we cleaned before use.   A few corners in rooms were bad, but it was ""relatively"" clean and not a complete disaster. 
- avoid bringing a car, parking is challenging.  
- The building is past the point charming, its simply run-down.  The common space in the entry rugs show wear and tear, the electrical system looks aging with ancient outlets and light switches that need replacing even though the host replaced a few lightbulbs for us.   Outlets are scarce and are quite old.  Counter appliances can be used only one at a time with a single outlet . 
- Lots of cosmetic drywall problems with crooked walls, uneven ceilings , half painted paneling /half drywall, holes, places for towel bars and closet rods that were missing, etc.   Unfinished repair job with duct tape instead of drywall tape in the bathroom.    
- Unfortunately painters were overenthusiastic and paint was everywhere, hitting light switches which should have been replaced, trim and on spots on the new wood floor 
- Beds sagged and creaked for us....any movement. New mattresses needed?  
- no extra linens or blankets or kitchen towels

 Some TLC and good contractors (a drywall contractor, professional painter, electrician) could get the place in shape.   But as it is, its not quite up to snuff.  

Interestingly, one of the other renters ""Steve"" in Jan 2016 mentioned that it was more of ""place for a few college kids to stay"" which is our experience, as its not quite up to our standards.   That same renter mentioned an old dishwasher on the back porch which is still on the back porch and not removed as of Apr 1. "
373,-1,"we stayed for two nights, the subway around the corner is very convenient. the apartment is small but had everything we needed. The kitchen would have needed some extra cleaning - the table and area around the sink were greasy despite the high cleaning fee we payed. "
374,-1,"Cindy's place was great. Though I didn't get a chance to actually meet her, her responses were always quick and in great detail. Had 0 issues at all. only about a 5-7 minute walk to the Allston St T stop or about the same distance to the 66 bus stop and more. If you're hungry the Allston Diner, Grasshopper, Roxy's, Spikes and Fomu are all within walking distance.  there's also a CVS and Walgreens a stones throw away. I stayed in room 3, only advice I can give to any future guests is to make sure you set your alarm in the morning as there are no windows so you can never really tell what time it is by guessing haha.
Thanks Cindy."
375,-2,"Cindy nous a très bien reçu, et disponible pour notre arrivée. Après plusieurs nuits d'hôtels à NY et Niagara falls, c'était un vrai plaisir de terminer notre voyage à Boston en logeant chez elle. Le quartier est très calme, la green line très proche ainsi que divers commerçants. Avec mon fils, on en gardera un très bon souvenir. Encore merci pour tout, Cindy."
376,-1,This place my first airbnb experience. Really bad place for resting. Very noisy.
377,-3,"Tyree's apartment is located in a quiet, older neighborhood a short distance from Downtown Boston. ($10 Uber ride to anywhere downtown).   There isn't a lot of stores, restaurants, etc near the apartment, so you will need to drive to these locations.  If  you rent a car, Tyree will cone off a parking space for you in front of the house.  Parking is limited, so it's great that she will do this for you. If you plan to go outside of town (Plymouth, Salem, Cape Cod) you will need a car.  But, if you plan on staying in Boston the whole time, I would suggest that you use Uber and save money. 

The house itself is 200 years old which is unique, but the studio apartment is very modern with hardwood floors, recent paint, kitchen sink, small fridge,  cable TV and Wi-Fi.  

Tyree and her husband were very welcoming.  They are very nice people and genuinely seemed concerned about making sure that we had everything we needed.  Tyree provided a cell phone for her and her husband, and told us that we could contact them anytime (they live downstairs on a separate floor).  

The apartment has it's own entrance and is very nice.  The place was extremely clean and we had no issues whatsoever.  There is also a great view of the city!  However, I would warn the elderly about the stairs.  Since it's an old house, the stairs are narrow and steep and there is a lot of them! So, if you have knee problems or any issues with climbing stairs, this may be of concern to you. 

Overall, this was a great place to stay.  We have no doubt that if we ever return to Boston, we will stay in Tyree's apartment again!  

Thanks Tyree! 

"
378,-1,"Tyree accommodated our early arrival and  the apt itself was as expected. Public trans to Boston took longer than expected due to out of service line and a few inexperience mistakes, so I recommend taking an uber. We had trouble with the wifi and Tyree was very responsive to communicating a fix. "
379,-1,"Oui, l'hôte a été présente dès notre arrivée jusqu'à notre départ. Il nous a été fourni diverses informations concernant la ville. Le logement correspondait à l'annonce, et convenait tout à fait pour un couple! Une bonne expérience!"
380,-2,"Beacon Hill is a great location to stay in. It is very walkable to many major sights and the T is close by. The apartment was smaller than we thought, but I think that is normal for an apartment in the heart of Boston. No major problems and if anything was wrong it was fixed within one day. There is only one AC window unit and that did make it a little hard for my boyfriend to sleep during the hot summer nights, but I was OK. Overall, it was a great place. "
381,-1,"Stay was a-ok.  A few suggestions:
-Put the wifi password somewhere for people to find
-Get another electrical outlet put in so people don't have to do power cord gymnastics to have the A/C and TV plugged in.
-The Roku box is cool but useless since it just drops in the middle of every program (you probably want a wired connection instead).
-Put some (even cheap) shampoo in the bathroom for people."
382,-2,"This was the first time I've left a rental midway through a trip. I left and paid MORE to stay in a hotel. I wish I would have seen the most recent review at the time I booked this place (the review posted very recently and I book a couple months ago), because I never would have booked the stay.

Everything in the previous review by Gang is 100 percent accurate. Bare in mind this language barrier, he's speaking to the sounds the heater made rather than the AC. The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While I'm grateful it was turned on, I couldn't sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen. 

Also, the lighting is completely off in the photos provided. The space is very dark. Additionally, there was salt from the recent snow tracked through the entire place and a bag of dirty laundry by the door. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that someone/a company was coming by to pick up this dirty laundry while I was there. I ended up carrying all of my luggage with me to a conference because I had no idea who had the keypad code to this place.

The bed is terribly uncomfortable and, for the current temperatures of 10 degrees at night, there is insufficient bedding available. You're told specifically in the host instructions not to take any additionally bedding from the closet... despite the THIN ""comforter"" provided. The bed is no better than a pull-out couch with a metal bar in your back.

I was so uncomfortable and unhappy with this listing, I stayed one night and left the next day for a hotel. I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there."
383,-7,"Summary: Unwelcoming and rude host, small, dirty apartment. 

From the second we arrived at the apartment we felt extremely unwelcome. Christopher did not pick us up or meet us at the apartment, which is not a requirement, but he could have left a welcome pack or at least a list of where things were/how they worked.

The actual apartment was filthy. The cleaner had done the best he could, but the filth was more severe than that. Little holes in the wall, damp on the ceiling, build up of dust on all ledges and a constant smell of mould.

It is a tiny apartment and the photos are very deceiving. What we thought was a wardrobe in the photos, was in fact the pull out bed folded up. Our friends were going to join us but luckily they could not as the apartment cannot fit 4 people, as Christopher has advertised.

We were left with one roll of toilet paper, a speck of washing up liquid and nothing else. Again not a requirement, but something we have not experienced at other airbnbs.

When we contacted Christopher throughout our stay he was unresponsive and unhelpful. When it came to checkout we needed somewhere to store our bags. Understandably someone else was booked in that day so we could not leave our bags, but Christopher was impolite and failed to even try and find a solution. He acted like it wasn't his problem.

Before this trip we have had such a positive experience from airbnb, but this stay hasn't come close. The location is good, but so is the location of hundreds of other apartments listed on airbnb in Boston - stay at one of those, not here. "
384,-3,"I'm generally very laid back and don't complain, however, don't mess with my sleep, and don't mess with my comfort. This apartment did both. 
Apparently, the thermostat is a decoration. It does nothing. I tried. (The temp also showed about 67 degrees--there is NO way!!)
The apartment was absolutely uncomfortably baking my whole 48 hours there. My friend stopped by and she keeps her own home a ghastly 75 degrees, and this place was too hot for her! 
Both nights I slept fitfully and sweaty in 2-3 hour bursts and only got slight relief by opening the front door for 5 mins to cool off. I admit I run warmer than some, but it's never been a problem when there's a thermostat to adjust.
(The windows are hard to reach and the screen was out so leaves and street trash blew in when opened)
The bed is memory foam so...a giant heat sponge. 
There is a fan, but to blow around hot air? 
Also, I stay at AirBNB apartments to try and get that cozy, at home feeling. This apartment has the atmosphere warmth of a business traveler hotel. 
I have loved all my previous AirBNB experiences. This one...not so much. #fail"
385,-2,"Not a great stay as 

-        There was no door between the kitchen and the bedroom and was listening to the humming of the fridge all night

-        There was a curtain/ blind missing on the door so people could see me in my bed

-        The neighbours upstairs started to play loud music at 11.45 pm

Although mentioned not having internet was not great"
386,-2,"Appartement situé en sous-sol. Très peu de lumière malgré les photos. En effet si vous laissez les rideaux ouverts les passants vous voient.
Il manque une table et des chaises pour manger !
Le quartier est néanmoins superbe. De fait l'emplacement est idéal.
Quant à Christopher nous ne l'avons jamais vu.
Impossible d'en dire plus sur notre hôte. L'entrée et la sortie de l'appartement se fait via un code."
387,-1,"Due to flight delays, I was only able to crash here for a few hours, but the room and bed were much appreciated."
388,-4,"My wife and I did not have a great experience at this location. We had been told that a key would be in a lock box but it wasn't, after an hour and a half of waiting (and contacting airbnb) we finally got in touch with the host and were able to get in. Once inside the apartment complex smelled of smoke. The apartment was a mess and the room we stayed in was not the one pictured. It was far worse. Woke up to a cat litter box outside our door and the apartment itself smelling of smoke. We never actually met Tom, and the only time we spoke with him was after the hour and a half of waiting and him letting us know his roommate was upstairs to let us in. 

This listing is certainly not family friendly as it suggests. In addition, even after all the we went through I have yet to receive any type of apology from Tom. 

Very unimpressed."
389,-1,"Regrettably, I did not stay with Tom.  I let him know and he was really lovely about the cancellation.  Will certainly stay with him (if he'll have me) on my next trip to Boston"
390,-1,"Tom was very friendly and a great host, but the situation wasn't what we expected: he rents out 4 bedrooms in a small turn-of-the-century apartment. When we arrived there was such a strong smell of marijuana (from another guest) that I felt sick to my stomach, and people came and went loudly late at night and early in the morning. Also, all 4 bedrooms share one tiny bathroom, so you might wait in line at 1:30 in the morning. (You also might see guests repeatedly coming out of the bathroom in their underwear, as we did.) With that kind of high-traffic place, cleanliness was also something of an issue. It's convenient to the airport so if you need a quick cheap place to crash, go for it - just be aware that you're getting what you paid for/ that the experience may vary wildly. I wouldn't stay again."
391,-1,So close to the airport! Really quick trip to Boston and this place allowed us to get onto our early morning flight with no problem. 
392,-1,"Prima plek om te overnachten. Het is vlak bij de metro, dus je bent net zo makkelijk in de stad als op het vliegveld. "
393,-1,L'appartement était comme dans le descriptif et idéalement situé. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour. Et si un jour je dois revenir à Boston sur nous reviendrons ici et je le conseillerai à mes amies. Nous sommes sortis le soir et aucun problème de sécurité. Tout la famille était heureuse de ce séjour. La communication a été très facile car nous n'avions pas les codes Wifi mais dans l'heure qui a suivie nous avons eu les codes. Merci pour la rapidité de réponse.
394,-2,"Simply put the worst experience with AirBnB. The place was not only basic, it was dirty, the mattress covers were stained and the comforters were stinking. Avoid this place."
395,-1,"Totallement fidèle à la description, cette chambre est idéale pour un court séjour. A deux pas du métro, tout près de Main Street (Charlestown), facile d'accès depuis l'autoroute et stationnement facile. Appartement complet et assez spatieux. Jurek est toujours disponible et répond très rapidement à nos demandes. J'y retournerai assurément à ma prochaine visite de Boston."
396,-5,"To be avoided:  excessive noise and poorly maintained apartment for the price.   There is loud construction going on 24/24:  across the street in Fenway park all night long and then right next door beginning at 7am and very loud.  We were unable to sleep and moved to a hotel at our expense the last night. They say ""luxury"" apartment, which I contest:  Some amenities were included, but over all the blinds were not working in the living room, the hair dryer and disposal were broken, and the trash can was missing in the bathroom.  This is run by a corporation, and the apartment you see here will not necessarily be the one you get.  Yes, it was a suite, but if you like your sleep don't stay here--you're better off at a hotel.

À éviter à tout prix: Il y a plusieurs sites de construction actifs 24/24 juste à côté:  l'un dans le parc de Fenway le soir, l'autre dans le terrain en bas de l'immeuble à partir de 7h du matin,  et les 2 sont extrêmement bruyants.  Impossible de dormir, et nous sommes partis dormir à l'hôtel de dernier soir à nos frais.  Malgré la prétention d'être un ""appartement de luxe"", je trouve que l'entretien n'était pas ça:  oui, il y avaient quelques agréments mais le store était cassés dans le salon, le sèche-cheveux et broyeur (dans la cuisine) étaient cassé, pas de poubelle dans la salle de bain, rideau de douche inadapté (et fuites par terre).  Le propriétaire est une entreprise avec de nombreux appartements--vous n'aurez pas forcément celui que vous voyez dans l'image."
397,-1,Le séjour était vraiment agréable. Le studio était propre et très pratique. Yonathan a été disponible tout le long de notre présence et il y avait des snacks ainsi que des boissons à disposition. Je recommande vivement et j'espère pouvoir revenir prochainement lors d'une autre visite à Boston. Merci !
398,-7,"Worst Airbnb experience yet. I'm not sure where all the positive reviews come from. Especially since the purpose of my negative review has been mentioned in numerous reviews. First off, check in time is ridiculous. 4pm?! Hotels don't even have check in that late. This is and will be a problem if you're arriving anytime before 2 pm. I contacted Yonantan about dropping off my luggage while the cleaning lady prepared the place. I was told to contact the cleaning lady. Her information is on the listing as a person of contact. I proceeded to call the number and was greeted with a very rude and unprofessional woman on the other end. She told me I needed to call Yonantan back and arrange a drop off time. They would then relay the information to her. Already a lack of communication. So and so messaged me to let me know he spoke to the cleaning lady and she is aware that I will be arriving at 130 to get the key and drop off my luggage. Mind you, the previous guest checked out by 11am. I arrived to the place at 130 and come in contact with the cleaning lady. Once again she was very rude and unprofessional. She told me she was never notified by Yonantan and was not aware of me stopping by. More lack of communication. She didn't want to give me the key and refused to let me leave my luggage inside. She said I could leave it outside on the porch. Negative. When I tried to show her the message from Yonantan she quickly slammed the door in my face while I was still talking. I was shocked. After 30 minutes I was finally able to get a hold of Yonantan. He told me to leave my luggage on the porch and he would have the cleaning lady put it inside once he got a hold of her. I returned at 11pm later that night to find my luggage sitting outside on the porch!! This isn't the best neighborhood so im lucky it wasn't stolen. I'm not sure the relationship to the cleaning lady but I feel she is a friend or family member. Any employee of mine who is irresponsible, rude and unprofessional would no longer be an employee of mine. Seems like this is a normal pattern for her based on reviews. Nothing has been done and it will cost the owner of this studio money. Oh and no need to set your alarm clock. You will be awakened every morning around 7am by the people upstairs. They are loud! The unit itself is nice on the inside. Newer, remodeled unit. No problems with the wifi, ac, or , hot water. There are complimentary snacks and drinks for guest. Also body wash and shampoo. However the place was a little dirty. There was hair all over the floor. Restroom, bedroom, living room had black hair everywhere. Taking 5 hours to clean a unit, one..."
399,-1,"logement situé en plein centre ville favorisant un déplacement à pied.
Idéal pour un séjour à Boston.
Tout simplement le meilleur des logements"
400,-1,"Le cottage est fantastique, une véritable petite maison avec tout le nécessaire et plus encore. Panier gourmand offert dans la cuisine, panier santé/beauté dans la salle de bain, classeur avec une multitude d'informations pratiques pour nous faciliter la vie ! Carl et Judy sont charmants et prêts à rendre service et aider sans être trop présent. Se réveiller à la lumière du jour avec la vue sur les arbres était un bonheur !"
401,-2,"Pros: Basically the location is extremely convenient in the Bay Back area, a turn away from Newbury Street. You are just steps away from shops, Prudential Centre, and tons of restaurants. There is even a city bike rent station just across the street. 

Cons: As pictured, but guests should know the unit is located in a basement that lack windows. So you are dependant on the air con / internal heat vents. If you have a lot of luggage, you will need to carry them down a narrow set of stairs. Also the decor is very tired. No Washer / Dryer. Also the second bedroom has a large gap above the door wall which could disturb light sleepers if you are going in and out. "
402,-2,"I'm always extremely hesitant about leaving a less than happy review, but sometimes an unhappy airbnb stay happens. I was clear with my host (Nancy) that I would arrive around 6 pm and would leave very shortly after to meet friends for dinner across town. When I arrived at the house at 5:45 I was greeted by a live-in relative (Charles) who did not know I was coming, which was very unsettling. He asked me to wait in the living room while he called Nancy but I had to insist that I be allowed to settle and unpack in my room since I was on a schedule. I was on a very quick business/personal trip, so I stayed at this house for only one night as I tried to squeeze everything into my itinerary as efficiently as possible. After he spoke on the phone with Nancy and confirmed my presence as a guest, he gave my a tour of the house and amenities. When he asked if I needed anything else I laughed, and mixed in with my regular friendly fare I told him I required only 2 things from any stay, a good nights sleep...and coffee in the morning, he shook his head in understanding. I couldn't get to sleep that night because I could hear two people engaging in a considerably loud conversation as they made other noises in the kitchen until 12:30 at night...and a printer going and going along with it in the background. I'm pretty laid back and don't require much when staying away from home since I come prepared, but I was disappointed with my experience here due to the external late night noise. But personally, the part that left the worst taste in my mouth was the next morning when I was trying to get out the door at 8:30am. Not only was there no fresh hot java flowing, but waiting for me on the counter was a pot of cold leftover coffee and a filter full of grounds...I was floored! "
403,-1,"Der Aufenthalt in Miriams Wohnung war perfekt für mich. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön hell, die Größe ist optimal und die Ausstattung ist gut durchdacht. Miriam ist sehr großzügig und hatte zur Anreise Lebensmittel zur Verfügung gestellt, dies war eine große Erleichterung für mich. Die Umgebung ist sehr interessant und auch einen großen Rundgang wert. Es gibt viele kleine Geschäfte und auch einen großen Supermarkt. Das Naherholungsgebiet Jamaica Pond mit eleganten Villen drumherum ist nicht weit weg. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind gut erreichbar. Ich habe mich immer sicher und gut aufgenommen gefühlt. Miriam und ihr Ehemann sind wirklich gute Gastgeber. Sollte ich nochmal nach Boston reisen, würde ich gerne wieder bei ihnen wohnen."
404,-1,Great location! Shops and restaurants within walking distance. Metro was a little longer but still very close. A/C was non-functioning but it was not a problem as it was shady and the weather was not too hot weather.
405,-1,"Das Appartment war genau das, was wir fuer unseren Boston-Trip gesucht hatten. Die Lage am Fenway-Park ist sehr schoen ruhig und zur Bahn sind es nur 2 Minuten. Wir sind aber meistens zu Fuss ueber die wirklich suesse und sehenswerte Newbury Street und durch den Public Garden Richtung Stadt gebummelt. Das Appartment war sauber und Brendan ein (wie es scheint) sportbegeisterter, sehr netter Gastgeber, den wir kurz kennen lernen durften.
Ich kann dieses Apt. weiter empfehlen. Wir haben uns dort und in Boston sehr wohl gefuehlt :-) "
406,-3,"The Airbnb photograph of the guest room is not representative of the general state of the property. The guest room wardrobe contained belongings of another person, hallways had furniture items which seemed to be in transit & the living room was occupied as a bedroom by two & sometimes three people with personal belongings scattered throughout.. The kitchen was in a state of disarray with unwashed dishes etc. 
Of particular concern was the unclean state of the kitchen, bathroom & floors.
On two occasions I found the door to my guest room open after returning from a day out- there was no way of locking the door to secure my belongings prior to leaving. This concerned me given that apart from the host there appeared to be two  other sets of guests certainly unknown to me & probably the host. While my property was intact the security was not satisfactory.

408,-5,"This apartment was not in conformity with the description. The original said there are 4 beds, in fact, only three beds and a sofa. Now they have modified the description.Our experience with Nathaniel was rather unpleasant. Seemingly, Nathaniel is willing to lease his apartment, however, he is unwilling or unready to help his lodgers who come afar. We booked the apartment for two nights, and communicated with him about parking of two cars. His answer seemed fine, indicating that we might park the car at an avenue for free or at a parking lot for $10/12 per day. But, his answer tuned out to be inaccurate, or misleading on the day of our arrival. We, who were new in Boston, was shocked to find that visitor parking was not permitted allowed along most streets, and limited to two hours at other streets. We went to the BU parking garage suggested by Nathaniel in his message, only to be told by the woman working there that overnight parking was not permitted. But, Nathaniel knew that we were to stay for two days, instead of two or a couple of hours. Then, I called his wife, telling her our situation and asking for help. She told us that she did not know about parking and would let her husband contact us. Until nearly 2 hours later, we received a message from Nathaniel (instead of a phone call in such emergence although), giving us three options, and saying that “please review my profile – all the information that you need about our house and parking is listed there”. As complete strangers in Boston, we were in need at that time, and immediately answered his message and inquired whether we could park our car for two days at any of the locations suggested in his options, but he has never answered this inquiry, even till today when I write my comments. Finally, after two-hour search, we, desperate and helpless, managed to find a parking lot several blocks away from the apartment and paid $48 for two-day parking. Therefore, seemingly, Nathaniel is willing to lease his apartment, however, he is unwilling or unready to help his lodgers who come afar."
409,-1,"Vanya fut une hôtesse très accommodante. L'appartement était très propre et très bien situé pour tous nos besoins.

411,-4,"The communication with Scott was great, he was quick to answer emails and texts. Check in and check out times were flexible which is a plus. The room however was quite lackluster. The pictures provided overly-flatter the house. A quick tour around the house and you realize the floors, kitchen, and furniture are quite filthy. Spatulas and knives with frosting and oil still dripping from them are laid out everywhere. The living room furniture although comfy, had a certain stench to it and just felt dirty. The most shocking part however, is the absence of locks on all doors besides Scott's room. If is quite unsettling knowing the bathroom door, as well as the room you will be sleeping in has no locks. P.S. air conditioning is provided as an amentitie on the listing, but it is not set-up; you literally have an air conditioner on the table. To re-cap, our stay here was fine, we had no problem with the host; the house was just a bit underwhelming."
412,-1,Sally and Bruce were very welcoming in spite of my late arrival! Will go there again.

414,-2,"The biggest issue abut the apartment is that Thursday through Sunday from 11pm till 4am it's impossible to sleep here – located on the ground floor of the building pizza and bar attacks lots of people, motorcyclists, so there're always a loud party and heavy traffic. 
And a good leaning might be useful for the apartment.
"
415,-1,"This studio apartment was located very close to everything we wanted to do and see. The room itself was clean and comfortable, but the bathroom has not been updated and was very old and unappealing.  The noise from the bars and street traffic below this street facing studio were VERY loud and even earplugs were inadequate to subdue sounds.  FYI-The entrance stairs are very steep and there is no elevator.  Entrance and building hallways do not appear well-cared for, though studio was updated. On the positive side, Eddie was responsive to a couple of issues we had and resolved them quickly.  On the whole, we sacrificed appeal for convenience.  "
416,-1,The apartment was exactly as shown. All of the appliances and utilities were in working order. Beautiful space. Only issue was the occasional noise from Tremont st. And even that is not enough to dissuade me from renting this space again. 
417,-2,"when we arrived, we waited 20 min before entering in the apt. The stairs were dirty and the apt was very dusty. A week after, we fought against a giant beetle (we lost). The apt is small but is located in the center of the city, very close to the Boston common and the main streets. The japanese restaurant at the corner is fantastic."
418,-2,"Ahmed's assistant, Eddie, was really nice and gave me the keys/ brought me up to the condo. The building is RUNDOWN and so is the apartment. It is definitely not as fresh and clean as it appears in the pictures. The walls seem to have cracked in some places because there are white patches around that no one bothered to paint. I made the mistake of looking under the bed and there was a disgusting amount of dust. With the cleaning fee that AirBnB charges, I was really turned off. (It certainly was not professionally cleaned.) The threshold to the doorway has duct tape holding it in place and so does the AC in the window. It also smelled like cigarette smoke periodically. (I imagine due to a smoking neighbor.) Overall, it was fine and did the trick while I was in Boston for a few days, but it wasn't anywhere close to as lush as it appears in the pictures. "
419,-8,"First I would like to day that Boston is an amazing town. I am happy we made the trip and got to experience a small portion of what the city has to offer. However, I was very disappointed in the overall cleanliness of the apartment. We arrived and struggled up to the second floor. More steps than we were led to believe existed. Both my wife and I are recovering from medical issues that limit our mobility. This was described when the reservation was made. We opened the door to the apartment and my wife about fell over from the musty and dusty atmosphere. 
The apartment had obviously been going through some sheet rock repairs. Patches obvious in every room. The dust from sanding these patches had not been cleaned up. The tile in the bathroom had signs of mold in the grout. Again dust and dirt everywhere. It was not cleaned after the patches we re e sanded. The bathroom sink and mirror were dusty and the hot water faucet ran at a dribble constantly. The ventilation fan grill above the sink was also filthy. I have never experienced such disregard for a renters health and comfort. Doubt I will ever use this host again."
420,-4,"The location was excellent but this place had it's down falls. The apartment did not appear to be the same size as the pictures or as nice. It was overpriced for its amenities and size. The noise was the worst part of the experience. There is an Irish pub and pizza place below the 12 foot window, which means there was a lot of noise between 2am and 4am. We were not warned or prepared for that after being exhausted from the day. My girlfriend and I finally fell asleep at midnight and we were abruptly woken up to sirens, people screaming, and horns blasting at 2am. The noise didn't stop until 4am. That was exhausting. Overall it was a great location to the city, the place was clean, but the place was overpriced for its noise/amenities."
421,-2,"The listing and photos give the impression of this BnB as being clean and stylish. In actuality, it's pretty tossed together and messy. Parts of the wall are unpainted, ceiling tiles are moldy, and there's a few cracks in corners, raising the suspicion that vermins could sneak through (especially possible given the location right above a cheap pizza joint). Most disappointing is the dribbling shower head, which provides an underwhelming shower experience. Still, for the price and easy walking distance to major attractions, I've seen worse."
422,-2,"The listing description was spot on. Perfect location, old building but the apartment was very well kept. It was also a little noisy but you can't blame people wanting food after a night out drinking (you have been warned). One thing to note, the thermostat is locked and you will not be able to change the temperature. It wasn't an issue for me, but it can be during warmer/colder months.  "
423,-3,"The location is perfect and the apartment is nice. However, a lot of drawbacks. Dealing with a corporation rather than a regular host proved annoying. There was no roku as advertised. The instructions were wrong in terms of setting up the TV . The TV never stayed hooked up to the wifi. They kept giving us incorrect Netflix passwords. A rep was supposed to meet us 3 diff times to bring by leasing paperwork (never had to deal with that before) but she never came only to show up unannounced on our third day. Also parking in this part of town is a nightmare. I wouldn't stay in a property managed by this company again. "
424,-1,"Christina est charmante, son appartement est bien situé et propre. Elle a tout fait pour nous faciliter le séjour, tout en restant discrète. "
425,-2,"Very small, cramped room. Unfriendly host, who does not care about his guests. Had to go after him to get the keys to the apartment. No breakfast, not even coffee. Would not rent the room again! "
426,-1,"The room was all it was made out to be. Very small, but with a closet and storage under the bed. At the bedhead, a sink with mirror. Shared spaces were generally in good shape and reasonably spacious. Perhaps the only weakness was a lack of a vacuum, which meant that the carpet in living room became surprisingly stuffed with particles. 
  The host  was efficient and took pains to do a good operation. Often helpful, such as providing (an empty) metro card.
  Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to reach him afterwards. It's frustrating, because I seem to have left something valuable. Repeated mails have gone unanswered. 
  All in all, good value for the money, but with some caveats."
427,-1,"I like the place event thou you can hear everything at the building but I loved the area. The only this it was he had s little issue with the parking spot we payed, and it was very difficult to get in touch. Nothing happened big happened at the end, but it was frustrating not know what to do."
428,-1,"Nous avons adoré notre séjour au Fort Hill Inn! L'appartement est absolument magnifique, spacieux et surtout à distance de marche de tous les attraits touristiques de Boston! On s'y sentait comme à la maison, on y trouve tout ce qu'on a besoin (contrairement à presque toute chambre d'hôtel). Nous n'avons pas eu le chance de croiser Terry, mais il serait assuré que tout soit OK à notre arrivée! Merci Terry!"
429,-2,"Unfortunately our stay at this apartment started off badly. We arrived in the early evening only to discover that it had not been cleaned from previous guests. The bed was unmade, there were used towels in the bathroom, the bins had rubbish in them and the carpets were dirty and in need of a vacuuming. I rang Seamless Transition immediately but no-one answered the phone and so I left a message advising of the state of the apartment and asked them to call my sister in law who lived in Boston as we had no phone at the time. The next morning we got no response despite my phone message and a email I had sent. My sister in law finally rang them and they apologized saying they would organize a cleaner immediately. To their credit, we were given a refund of 1 nights accommodation (through negotiations with airbnb) but we were disappointed that at no time did they contact us to apologise. The apartment itself was fine, well appointed (apart from a bedside lamp not working due to loose wires and a hopeless wireless internet that involved having to login every time you used it, would also not work on mobile devices). The apartment was in a fantastic location with many restaurants and cafes nearby. Boston Common was also close by, as was the subway. The only other disappointment was the lack of information in the apartment about the Boston area, there was none. The cleaner also turned up a day earlier than check out to clean the apartment so it seems there are a few issues around communication with the cleaners."
430,-1,"The place was a
mazing. Everything was great.   Great locations . A lot of restaurants, cvs, train  station in 2 sec from apartment.  One small problem if you have a car, it's no parking. Overnight parking so hard to find. But its possible."
431,-2,"logement bien situé, quartier calme et assez proche du métro
le descriptif présente 3 lits mais il y a seulement 2 lits et un canapé non convertible. Un troisième matelas est proposé en supplément de 25$ par nuit. Les serviettes de toilettes étaient trop peu nombreuses (une seule par personne) et de dimension ridicule (1 seule de bain pour 4 !). L'équipement de la cuisine ne comprend ni grille pain, ni cafetière, ni bouilloire. Bref trop cher pour la prestation proposée. très peu de contact mais interventions efficaces et réactive nous n'avons jamais rencontré Polina. Les modalités pour la garer la voiture méritent d'être améliorées."
432,-2,"Lacking in day to day items. Not many cooking utensils. No information on the area about shops & so forth. A little out of the way. 
Beds were uncomfortable "
433,-1,Great apartment and location.  Only issues were that the neighbors were very loud and no extra toilet paper.
434,-2,"Although I do believe our host attempted to make us have a comfortable stay, there were some pretty terrible parts that really affected our stay.  First of all, the thermostat was set to go down to 54 degrees automatically every evening and in the 60s during the day.  The program set (once I found it) had it triggered to go down multiple times during the day and evening.  No matter what we turned it up to, it automatically turned it back down.  Needless to say, we both got the flu.  Being there for work where we had to go to the conference center was terrible.  Not only were we sick, but the walk brought us through the area that was burnt out factory buildings.  Not the safest for two girls to walk through.  The neighborhood is up and coming and had some fun spots.  Food was easy to find and the actual street we were on was ok.  What was also a horrible part of the experience was the neighbors.  On Saturday night there was a huge party up and down the block due to a parade the next day.  The lack of insulation had the two sick, cold girls left with no sleep.  For the next night, the neighbors upstairs had a fight so bad that we almost called the police.  Terrible.  So no sleep that night.  Then the final night had street work with jack hammers happening all night.  I have a video of jack hammers going at 3:00 am, so very unhappy.  Overall, this was not a great experience and with the thermostat control, downright miserable.  I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are going here for work.  "
435,-1,"Michelle est une hôte sympathique, disponible rapidement en cas de besoin, et bonne cuisinière de surcroît. Ça fait toujours plaisir de découvrir sur la table de la cuisine des gâteaux à grignoter de temps à autre. Le logement était tel que décrit, j’ai beaucoup aimé ma chambre, assez spacieuse avec un espace dressing. Ainsi que la maison qui a son charme, avec plusieurs chats qui viennent dire bonjour de temps en temps (la plupart du temps ils restent à l’étage). Le quartier est résidentiel, avec un petit convenience store au bout de la rue. Les supermarchés sont plus loin. Il y a un arrêt de bus à 10mn à pied et un arrêt de métro (Roxbury crossing, ligne orange) à 15mn, avec 2 collines sur le chemin. De nuit, je n’ai jamais eu de problème en revenant de Roxbury crossing, et préférais passer par là plutôt que Dudley square. Comptez à peine 1/2h porte à porte si vous allez en cours à Northeastern university, pratique en bus ou à un arrêt de métro. Si vous aimez marcher, le temps de trajet revient à peu près au même. Dans l’ensemble une très bonne expérience de 5 mois, que je renouvellerai avec plaisir."
436,-1,"Un endroit idéal pour visiter Boston, le quartier est magnifique, facile d'accès près du métro. Tiffany était là pour m'accueillir , c'est une hôte formidable,souriante et toujours prête à vous aider. La chambre très propre correspondait parfaitement à l'annonce, pas de mauvaise surprise.
J'ai pris le métro pour rejoindre l'aéroport , ligne directe et très pratique.
Après une expérience désastreuse à New York, j'étais heureuse de trouver une hôte aussi charmante.
Tiffany, merci pour tout, vous avez ensoleillé mon séjour !! "
437,-2,The street was quite close to the room and so it was noisy if there were cars passing by. No problems for the other things!
438,-3,"Very disappointing.  The place is small which was clear in the ad but the host had the only very small closet almost completely filled with her own clothes and the floor was filled with shoes plus the shelf was full. There was opened food in the refrigerator ( from a previous guest?) and the refrigerator was dirty. She only provided one towel to each of us for a 4 day stay, no way to get clean ones, and no small towels or washcloths.  Bed frame squeaks quite loudly.  Air conditioner was very difficult to reach and loud.  There was a sewer smell in the bathroom for much of the time. Great location but the overall experience was disappointing.  Would not return."
439,-1,Natalia ist eine sehr sympathische und hilfsbereite junge Frau. Sie hat uns sehr viele gute Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt in Boston gegeben. Es sind nur wenige Minuten zu Fuß zur nächsten U-Bahn Station. Man kann problemlos in 15 Minuten Downtown Boston erreichen. In der Nachbarschaft gibt es gute Restaurants für take away und kleine Supermärkte. Leider gab es für alle Gäste (zu unserer Zeit waren zwölf Personen in der Spitze im Haus) ein Badezimmer in dem auch die Toilette war. Dies führte zum Teil zu sehr langen und nervigen Wartezeiten. Leider waren weder die Zimmer noch die Küche und das Badezimmer  sehr sauber. 
440,-4,"I found communications with Joan were a little short on detail and and a little cursory and short.
We arrived at the house and found it difficult to get our cases up the steep front stairs of differing heights. 
Front access is very easy despite the somewhat puzzling overemphasis on how to use the locking system on the house's Airbnb site and again in instructions.
The final instructions were very skimpy and when we got in the door I needed to check the Airbnb site for clarity on which parts of the house were for our access.
Despite the description that the property is independent, on entry to the house there are stairs to an upstairs area.  
The house was dark and dingy with low ceilings and a strange smell.  Certainly not the relatively bright space that the photos portray.
We dropped off our cases despite growing misgivings about the house and left to drop off the rental car at the airport.
While we were away we discussed our experience of the house and agreed we should not stay there.  We got a cab, collected our things from Joan's space and checked into a hotel.
Sadly Joan's reaction to a very polite advice of our decision was to be condescending.  A gracious reaction would have been more appropriate, considering Joan was still receiving all the payment due to our late cancellation.  
Awfully glad we didn't stay!

441,-1,"Hugo m'a écrit plusieurs messages pour savoir quand j'allais arriver et ensuite il m'a très bien indiqué comment accéder à son logement. Il m'a même récupérée à la station de métro tout en m'aidant avec mes bagages. Je me suis sentie tout de suite à l'aise car il était très disponible, à l'écoute de toutes demandes et très accueillant. Il m'a conseillé des lieux à visiter sur Boston et des lieux pour me restaurer. Hugo est un hôte très agréable et sympathique que je recommande.  Les autres personnes qui y vivent le sont tout autant. Son appartement était très propre et agréable.  De plus, il est situé au centre de Boston. Il n'y a que quelques pas à faire pour accéder au métro, 2 stations plus tard vous êtes près de beaucoup de lieux intéressants à visiter. Boston est une ville très facile d'accès et très jolie. Je vous conseille de prendre le pass 7 jours si vous voulez en profiter sans vous ruiner ! Seulement 21 dollars !"
442,-1,"Jason und Stéphanie sind sehr offene und freundliche Gastgeber. Die Unterkunft entsprach genau der Beschreibung. Wir wurden sehr gut informiert und bekamen gute Tipps. Die Lage/Nachbarschaft ist angenehm,  die T-Station ist  in 2 Min. zu Fuss erreichbar und man ist im Nu im Zentrum. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können die Unterkunft bestens empfehlen."
443,-2,"Dies war unsere erste Airbnb Erfahrung. Alex und Matt waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Unsere späte Anreise (22.00 Uhr) war kein Problem für sie, diese Flexibilität haben wir sehr geschätzt. Das Haus ist sehr schön und ruhig gelegen. Man ist schnell (ca. 20min) mit dem Auto im Zentrum von Boston. Und wer Katzen mag ist hier definitiv richtig ;) die Katzen sind supersweet!"
444,-1,"Yes, they did. We didn't experience any difficulty finding their place."
445,-1,"Le lieu est très loin du centre. On peut y aller par transport en commun mais c'est long.

Le lieu en soi n'était pas sale, mais du fait qu'il s'agissait d'un garage de maison aménagé, il était assez humide (malgré la présence d'une machine permettant de déshumidifier l'air) et surtout j'ai pu constater l'arrivée d'un mille-patte (!) dans la salle de bain.
On avait un sentiment relatif d'insalubrité au final. Pas très accueillant.
Par contre, de gros aménagements ont été faits pour la location.

Autre souci, on entendait absolument tout de ce qui se passait à l'étage au dessus (spécialement dans le salon) : télé bruyante, pas de gens et de chien, le chien qui aboyait a 6h du matin ou a 23h ...

Ce que je regrette est le manque de communication. Difficile d'avoir des réponses de l'hôte pour savoir où se trouve le lieu avant mon arrivée et manque de communication en ce qui concerne le wifi à mon arrivée (peu d'informations et erronées qui plus est, mais qui s'est reglé par la suite). Informations sommaires quant aux questions que j'avais sur Boston et ses alentours."
446,-1,"The location was great and the hosts instructions were very good. We had no issues getting on the WiFi. 
The house needs some major repairs and the host was informed of these issues upon arrival. The ac was leaking. It is mounted over the bathroom door and caused the wood to warp so you could not close the bathroom door at all. It was also starting to warp the floors too. The doors all creaked loudly and the light over the stove did not work. There is no TV. There is also a strange door blocked by a dresser."
447,-1,"Communicating with the owner was a bit difficult because I had to ask how to check-in a couple of days before the trip rather than him telling me first. The response was relatively slow. I originally asked to book a different home that he owned and it actually expired with no response. However, he responded after it expired offering me this location which was nice. We left at 4AM and that was when I realized I was not given a check-out procedure. I messaged him but of course I did not expect a response since it was so early. So I just left the keys where I found them. There were no instructions to the wifi but we figured it out by just taking the tiny information off the side of router. 

The apartment, however, was a great location and very nice for the amount of people we had. Very central and a short walk to everything and transportation."
448,-1,"One big problem was that the bedding what's dirty with hair, smudges and a used bandaid. There where no sheets. The fifth bed was non existent. Location was good even though there are many homeless people on the street. Check in and out was easy."
449,-1,"Die Unterkunft liegt sehr günstig (5-10 min vom Boston Common entfernt), die U-Bahn ist auch in der Nähe.
Für 4 Personen ist das Appartment gut ausreichend, allerdings ist es für 7 ausgeschrieben. Im Wohnzimmer gibt es noch eine Couch und eine Luftmatraze für zwei. Es gibt allerdings sind am Tisch nur 2 Stühle, das Geschirr reicht nicht für 7 Personen.
Laken und Tücher konnten wir anfangs nicht finden. Nach mehreren Kontakten mit Elkin (die sich schwierig gestalteten, wir fragen uns ob er Englisch verstand) fanden wir die Laken unter!! einem Sessel in einem Reißverschlussfach. Sie waren auch etwas knapp bemessen (so dass wir uns mit Handtüchern zudecken mussten). Sauber war alles, nachdem wir uns endlich verständigen konnten, klappte auch alles. "
450,-5,Host is hard to reach and the neighborhood was a tad sketchy for my taste. Had to call the cops at 4AM with a noise complaint from a loud parking lot party outside of the window. 
451,-2,"The location of this apartment was great.  There was plenty within walking distance - food, convenience stores, other neighborhoods.  Upon requesting the apartment, Elkin was quick to respond and very accommodating since the apartment I requested was actually booked so he offered us this one instead.

My group did not receive any check-in/check-out instructions.  When the first of my party arrived, she contacted him and he gave instructions on how to get key.  But, she did have to wait for someone to come out of the door so she could go in..not sure if she got lucky or what, but that could have been inconvenient if no one was there to open the outside doors.  Upon check out we put the keys back where we found them because we were not told otherwise.

My group felt very much so that the kitchen was a tease.  There was just enough that it was mainly functional but missing a lot of key things (oil, salt, pepper, cooking utensils, baking tray).  There were cups, plates and silverware, a spatula and a broken serving spoon.  So, like I said enough to get by but sort of a tease. Also, we only had half a role of paper towels (we ended up buying more) and no dish towels to dry the dishes/lay them out to dry.

We also ran into an issue with the bathroom ceiling leaking.  After being there the first night we noticed the ceiling was leaking in the bathroom.  On the next morning I texted to let him know but did not get a response.  When we arrived back later that day the entire ceiling tile had caved in (ruining a few of our toiletries) and causing for a hard time using the restroom.  I tried calling and texting and did not get a response and was told the number got disconnected.  I then used the messaging feature in AirBnB and get a response.  All together, it took about an hour once he responded and someone was here to clean up and about another hour until someone came to actually fix the issue.  Although, it unfortunately did not get fixed.  We discovered this was all related to the air conditioner being turned on, and with it being nearly 90 degrees out, it was necessary to have the AC on.

All in all, the apartment was exactly how it appeared in the photos.  If the kitchen had just a few more things and we didn't have the leaky ceiling snafu this would have been a great stay."
452,-1,"Communication parfaite à notre hôte ! Tout était en ordre pour notre arrivée ! L'appartement est bien situé. La terrasse n'est pas adjacente à l'appartement contrairement à ce que les photos peuvent suggérer. 

Pour le reste c'est nickel, on recommande !"
453,-1,Bien accueillis malgré notre retard. La chambre est comme décrite. Et Franck est sympathique. 
454,-1,Great communication. Video on how to get in. Early or late arrival or departure. Only issue was bed was rather lumpy.
455,-1,Dommage que l'on passe par une agence et qu'il n'y ait pas de clés car je n'ai eu aucun contact réel avec mon hôte.. 
456,-1,"Jeremy was very quick to respond with any questions or concerns we had. The house was in a really great location, with restaurants and shops and liquor stores, within walking distances. The house was old and neat with newer appliances and furniture. Only concerns we had where- there are ALOT of stairs outside and inside of the house, wasn't a problem for me but my mother in law had a little trouble getting around. The beds have awesome bedding but the beds suck! Not only were the mattresses uncomfortable but they had some unexplainable brown stains we noticed after stripping our beds. The bathroom was nice but the bathtub was something else! It was a small old cast iron tub with hardly any hot water,and super slippery. All in all the house was cool and kinda creepy. I would go back if this concerns were fixed and rental cost went down a bit more.  "
457,-6," I have traveled all over the world over 20 years and have never stayed anywhere where I felt compelled to write a complaint letter.  
We paid well over advertised rate for a 3-night stay, $2,300 + security deposit (rate advertised $585/$435 respectively). That was significantly more than either individual unit would cost for the 3 day stay. We asked for the whole house and received an acceptance. When we got to the facility, we found our rental was only for the upstairs,  a 4-bedroom, 1-bath fire trap.It had no usable safe exit from the bedrooms, the was bath set on a floor with visible damage, Paint was peeling from doors, the banister was not strong,the kitchen was very old and not updated or well equipped, (had to borrow a teapot!), stairways were slippery and creaky, air conditioning was wall units-2 of which were so old and noisy they made talking and/sleeping difficult and they were held in with cardboard paper supports, After seeing the place, part of my family (the part with kids) found other-last minute accommodations at a local hotel-costing us an additional $1200, We specifically requested that we rent the whole house. But, instead we were given only the upper half and the main floor was rented by others. How anyone thought 8 adults could survive in a broken down apartment with one very outdated bathroom is a mystery to me. The rental agent/owner did offer us an $1100 discount on the rent.   But, that seems insufficient now that we suffered through the units limitations....  In fairness, (although considering how badly misrepresented the facility was-not sure fairness is called for) the bottom  floor looked a little better. It was pictured on line. And, the location is really good. But, our unit was a dump! I have the pictures to prove it, too.
The unit needs TLC. I suspect a letter to the Jamaica Plain City Council and fire department might help or get it condemned."
458,-1,Robin was not here during the weekend we came and immediately offers her own rooms and beds. I did not meet her personally but we communicated by mail and their was no problem for check-in and check-out.
459,-1,Disappointed. Not value for money. Sleeping arrangement leaves much to be desired. 
460,-7,"The whole apartment was dirty, the ""bed"" (although let's be real and call it what it is- an old pullout couch) was so uncomfortable that our whole bodies hurt, and there were stains on the sheets. Her roommate walked in and out of our room at all hours of the night (11:30pm, 1:30am, 3am, 4am, 6am.. as is his right since his door is next to the couch) which made it very hard to get any kind of continuous sleep. He also played video games for much of the night. Then, at 6:30, our host loudly turned on the tv and radio and started rummaging around with seemingly no concern that we were there.  We left after 1 night even though we had booked two because we felt unsafe with a complete stranger walking past us all the time."
461,-1,Robin's place was just what I needed and in a fun location. I would stay there again no problem!
462,-2,"Appartement en longeur, très bruyant, en face d'une caserne de pompiers. 

Notre hôte n'était pas là pour nous recevoir mais une jeune femme d'une entreprise était là pour nous ouvrir l'appartement. L'accueil a été très succint et les draps pour le canapé étaient oubliés ( nous étions 5 et l'un devait dormir sur le canapé qui ne se déplie pas). On nous les a amené quelques minutes après. D'ailleurs le logement etait marqué pour 5 lors de notre reservation mais ensuite il etait marqué pour 4.
Gateaux apéritifs, thé mis à disposition. Appartement très propre.

Cet appartement est en longeur, style couloir, pas très pratique pour 5.  La petite Italie est un bon quartier, bien situé pour faire les visites à pied, mais cet appartement est très bruyant, particulièrement pour la chambre située côté rue, qui se situe en face d'une caserne de pompiers. Comme les climatiseurs sont installés dans les fenêtres, c'est comme si celles ci étaient ouvertes. Donc on entend toute la nuit les pompiers, appels, sorties en urgence... exténuant. La chambre du fond est côté cour et a également le bruit constant des climatiseurs de la cour,.... mais sans le bruit de la rue. 

Des rideaux opaques permettraient d'être réveillé moins tôt. 

2 chaises uniquement permettant de prendre le petit déjeuner à tour de rôle. 

Salle de bain très petite. 

Même si l'appartement était joli, avec une belle cuisine, nous avions hate de le quitter. 

Masques sur les yeux et boules quiez pour les oreilles de rigueur. 

Cet appartement conviendrait plus pour 3 personnes uniquement (couchage dans la chambre du fond et canapé du salon)."
463,-2,"David is responsive and always willing to help out whenever we had a problem. The place is huge, tastefully decorated and close to the train and trolley stops to go downtown. Overall we had a good time staying at David's house. 
But there are two complaints we do need to raise: 1. There's no dressing mirror in the house, which can be a problem for ladies while traveling and visiting friends. There was only one desk in the room. 2. David's friend Matt was taking care of the house and guests while he was away. We felt unwelcome by his cold and distant attitude. It was probably the only unpleasant experience we had in Boston. "

Je recommande !
Michel, Québec."
465,-1,"Great location in Back Bay, close to Fenway, which was exactly what we were looking for in our 2 night stay. Despite issues with the original room, accommodations were made for a comparable room, also basement level, but a little darker than the posted room.  Great overall experience and value. Would book again."
466,-1,Accueil très chaleureux de la part de Monique et de son mari qui sont vraiment adorables et qui ont fait le maximum pour que je me sente comme chez moi. J'ai beaucoup apprécié la salle de bains privée et l'accès à la cuisine quand je voulais ainsi que la propreté de tout l'appartement qui était irréprochable. Le vélo est aussi un plus et très pratique pour aller au centre de conférences ou à une station de métro. La proximité de la plage est très agréable. Les enfants sont très discrets et pas gênants du tout. Chambre à recommander sans problème. 
467,-1,Nous avons été très bien reçu. Mary-Kate s'est libérée pour nous accueillir alors que nous sommes arrivés plus tôt que prévu. L'appartement correspond tout à fait aux photos. Il est situé près de la station de métro.
468,-1,"A notre arrivée, Javier est venu pour voir si tout allait bien. Il nous a donné les codes wifi et s’est assuré que nous arrivions à nous connecter , il nous a aussi expliquer comment aller au Whole Foods à pied ce qui nous a été très utile. Le studio est spacieux, très confortable et très bien équipé. Tout y est pour se sentir comme à la maison. Il ne manque rien.  L'appartement étant en sous-sol, l'utilisation de la lumière artificielle était souvent nécessaire mais on s’y habitue très vite et nous avons pu profiter du patio en toute tranquillité, ce qui était fort appréciable. Si vous êtes matinal, vous pourrez faire connaissance avec les écureuils. Le voisinage est calme et agréable. La station de métro (Stony Brook sur la ligne orange) est très proche et il y a un parc juste en face. Nous avons beaucoup aimé notre séjour à Jamaica Plain."
469,-4,"The house matched the photos, was spacious. Our first time using AirBnB not sure how this would go. His 3 ring binder did have a great deal of helpful information. We had a party of 6 in town for a wedding.  Unfortunately we had a miss communication about the TV's and cable.  We had planned to watch the World Cup games in our down time.   The house had it pro's and con's.  The main living area and bedrooms were clean.   The bathroom only had one hand towel.  When we arrived there was two bars of opened used soap in the shower.  The freezer was filthy dirty and full of food, some of the countertops had stains.
He did leave us 6 different colored bathroom towels.  Poor quality, half of them were stained and smelled spoiled so we just shared among the family.
Location was great for our needs in Jamaica Plains.  Easy to walk to the necessary locations. But like other people have noted, it's tricky when ordering cabs because of the funky address, access and roundabout.  Depending on where you need to travel this might or might not be an issue.   You do need to cross the road 4 times (because of the roundabout)  and two of the crosswalks are on curves and the traffic moves very quickly (40 MPH).  If you have children or elderly people I would take this into consideration.   The Orange Line stop is quit a distance away, at least 1 mile.  Pack sneakers to walk because Emmanuel is not very forthcoming on the distance to all the restaurants, shops and grocery stores. We did enjoyed our stay.


 "
470,-2," We booked this house in January for a July vacation. It was listed as a single family with 1.5 baths and laundry.  Emmanuel was gracious to let us in at 1pm to drop off our stuff. We found the house clean for the most part, but only 1 bath and no laundry!  This was not a major inconvenience, but not what I paid for. We were not informed of the house being remodeled.  The cabinet where the pots were kept was dirty and the bathroom had used soap in the tub.  Also, there were wires sticking out of the wall in the hall. Most of the plugs in the house were 2 prong so we had to get adapters and an extension cord. The walk to the train took every bit of 20 min. The binder of pamphlets with sites to see and directions was helpful. Emmanuel did say he was keeping his car in the garage, of which we heard a few times. But he failed to mention that he was staying in the cellar as well!  After 3 days of running around Boston we figured that out and found it unsettling, but did not have enough time to change our accommodations. AGAIN THIS WAS LISTED AS A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE! That is what I paid for and would not have stayed knowing all this now. We also found the traffic noise was quite excessive, even with the air conditioners running, since you can see a two lane rotary from the front window. It was also hard to sleep hearing the sirens from the ambulances to the hospital 3 blocks away! I would not recommend staying there due to the noise factor and the misrepresentation of this being a single family house. "
471,-1,"Nos commentaires, sont les mêmes que la première semaine passée dans l'appartement de Bernie, cette deuxième semaine confirme tout le bien que nous pensons de cette location, avec en plus le partage avec Bernie. Si nous devions revenir sur Boston, nous essaierons de réserver la même location."
472,-1,"Alan ist ein sehr umsorgender Gastgeber, der sich wirklich sehr darum bemüht, dass man sich wohl fühlt. Das Appartment liegt in einer schönen Gegend und man kann von dort aus gut Boston erkunden. Ein Supermarkt ist in der direkten Nähe. Das Appartment ist in einem alten Gebäude und daher nicht ganz so gut in Schuss (insbesondere das Bad). Die Sauberkeit war in Ordnung.
Ich würde einen Aufenthalt bei Alan weiterempfehlen."

474,-1,The main problem with the accommodation was that the room could only be locked when we were in it. 
475,-1,"This is clearly the worst. No one meets up, emails, messages phone calls are unanswered. the entire apartment is occupied by her personal things so no storage [sit on floor and take out ur clothes from suitcases] . the apartment has poor maintenance viz moody shower, broken handrails,barely hanging flush handle, difficult to switch on dishwasher and less said about the laundry room the better. the apartment does not have a basic thing like a toaster !! the hostess [??] is clearly there to make money and wants to extract as much more  on any pretext or other which thank fully AirBnB overruled. Clearly a place to avoid if you are there for more than a day. "

There was a confusion with the check in, new regulations of the building and they staff couldn't let us in, and it had to be the host. This was very stressful due to my boyfriends flight landing from England in less than an hour. Travelling for 8 hours, this is not what we needed. Especially as we spent a lot of money to stay here, being stressed about check in was not needed. We've stayed at the building before with a different host and never had an issue. However, this was neither the host or buildings fault. Just a miscommunication. However, the host got to us as quickly as possible, and the rest of our stay was perfect."
477,-2,"I'm not really sure where to start. Before going into detail, I'll provide the bird's eye view of my experience. Despite this studio being slightly more expensive than others, we were really excited about this place due to the reviews, location and the photos. However, the owner never responded to our calls/emails/texts, the studio was unclean when we arrived, had bad towels and sheets, noisy and my fiancé and I ended up just buying a hotel the last night to have somewhere nice to sleep (even though we had already paid for this Airbnb). 

When we arrived, Bernie was unresponsive and a local neighbor/Bed and Breakfast had to track him down to get us keys.  When we finally got inside the studio, we noticed it wasn't cleaned from the previous tenants - full trash cans, towels on the floor, dirty bedsheets and loose hair everywhere.  Since I couldn't get a hold of Bernie, the local Bed and Breakfast (not associated with Airbnb) put my fiancé and I up for a few nights until the place could get cleaned.  I think they either managed Bernie's property, were helping him out or just being really really nice. The local Bed & Breakfast was great - the owners were accommodating in our situation. Unfortunately, this review isn't about them and about Bernie's place which is why it gets 2 stars.  

We stayed at Bernie's studio the last two nights of our five day trip (after three nights at the B&B). The place was (finally) cleaned nicely but we were still unsatisfied. The photos didn't do it justice. The sheets were about a 2 thread count and we had to cover the pillow cases with our t-shirts so they wouldn't scratch our faces while we slept. Plus, the comforter had weird stains on it. After one night there, we decided to scratch the studio and bought a hotel down the street to have a great place to sleep on our final night.

I was disappointed because I never felt like I wanted to spend time in the place we rented.   

We were told that due to the uncleanliness of the room when we arrived, our first night would be free (that is what the nice people at the B&B told us).  I still haven't seen a refund.

I have still never spoken to Bernie.

If I learned anything from my stay here, it's to ALWAYS get the Airbnb insurance. You never know what you're going to walk into.

I hope this review was helpful. I tried to be as straight forward and as positive as possible with our experience. "

482,-3,"Liza welcomed us, but then we never saw her again. The stairs to the 3rd floor were very narrow and steep. I wish I had realized that beforehand. It was a struggle getting our luggage up the front porch steps and then up 2 more flights of stairs. The first night we didn't know where the light was for the stairs so it was a little stressful going down these steep stairs in the dark to use the bathroom. Not the best neighborhood, even the Uber driver waited until we were safely inside. Too far out of the city to come back and change clothes if going out to dinner. Wished it was closer. I don't want to cause any loss for this hostess, but I wished others had mentioned these 2 points as I would not have stayed here. "
483,-1,"It's nightmare to being this house. The host never lived in the house, even don't leave a key to us, not only myself but the guy next door don't have a key either. When I went out room washing hands, the door locked, I can't enter the room, all of money, passport, clothes, belongs all lock. I ask a help from the guy who stay the next room, same book through bnb, even make phone call and message to the host but don't have any response, so I have. sit on the coach the whole night never sleeping, cold, stressed, until the next morning I run out for help from police at 6:00am. More, the whole house, apartment 1 and apartment 2 can be connected through basement, when we go to basement try to find a solution, and found that everywhere is people, two young ladies who even come up from basement told me the house lived even more the twenty people. It means here more like a cheap hotel instead a real air bnb room.  So not safe at all."

486,-7,"This property is listed thru a realtor working for the property management company. This picture shown, is not necessarily the apt you will get, as was the case with my rental. No fireplace, not as much space. I was 6R sixth floor but there is a small elevator so no problem and the apt was was cute. Plenty of towels and the bed is ok; if you're picky, 6R is not the bed for you. 
Here's the negative and the positive: 
The negative: strong smell of onions hung over the apt and lamp was broken; after s call quickly solved, not s big deal. But here's the bad:The second I arrived a noticed was handed out that the next day the water would be off from 10 am till at least 2 pm. For my purposes the next day, this sucked and was a real issue. It wasn't an emergency situation, but planned.  To find s new place was going to be s drag. I asked the managment company for 1/2 days rate as compensation. They didn't see the problem, were condescending, unfriendly and refused. 
   Here's the good news: AirBNB totally has your back. They understood completely, quickly agreed and granted the refund. 
The place and location are terrific. If any issue were to arrive, the realtor, posting the property and the property manager are most unpleasant; a first in my AirBnb experience. AirBNB is still awesome "
487,-2,"We were instructed to find the key in the mailbox, but to get to the mailbox we needed to go through a gate in the fence and then inside the front door, where there was a warning about dogs. I needed to call the host to figure out where it was. The basement apartment was smaller than expected, the floors seemed sticky, and it was just old. The neighborhood was OK - access to mass transit was about a 10 minute walk. The exterior of the house was not inviting. We were hoping that for only a little less than a Hotel room we would have gotten a little more, but that was not the case."

Le quartier est très sympathique. Le logement se trouve à cinq minutes de marche du métro. Nous avons laissé notre voiture stationnée dans la rue et tout s'est bien passé!"
492,-1,"I believe the pictures depicts the house wrongly. The rooms are very dark because the curtains and windows are closed at any time. Furthermore you are not allowed to go outside into the backyard and get some fresh air. That was really weird, when the host said that it was because the terrace was broken, but she used it herself. The bedrooms were fine and the breakfast was really nice with a lot of fruit. Susan helped us with barberque and that was so helpful of her. The main problem about this stay is that you dont feel like home at all. There is a lot of house rules, which is fine. But she turned very angry and kick the kitchen door when we took a piece of plastic for our food. That felt really unpleasant and you didn't want to be in the kitchen/dinning room. It was like walking in a mine field, you never knew when you were going to hit the mine. This is my very first try with AirBnB and way from succesfull. I believe that it is miss-guiding saying that the neighborhood is historic. It was nice that the metro was close, but you didn't want to go out at night in the area.   "
493,-2,"It was difficult finding a 1 bedroom apartment in Boston in a reasonable location in mid October over a month ahead of time.  We paid over $300 a night.

Traffic was backed up and we couldn't get to the apartment until just after the concierge left, and finding someone to help was difficult.

Sinon tous les bus qui emmènent à la gare sont à 2 minutes à pied. On rejoint  le centre ville en 45 minutes environ mais le quartier est très sympa aussi il y a des parcs... Donc pour le prix de la chambre c'est pas mal !  Je recommande !
500,-9,"This was our first AirBNB experience and likely our last.  While Kevin who greeted us was warm and helpful, the property was really awful from the moment we approached the front door.  The small landscape area was covered in garbage and the front door was covered in bird poop.  Once inside the hallway walls were filthy and the smell was overpowering.  The apartment was on the 3rd floor, which we expected, but the climb up the dilapidated stairs was an adventure.  The door into the apartment was flimsy with a large gap under it.  The air conditioning unit was the size of a large shoebox and placed in a front window, it was completely useless and wasn't powerful enough to cool a closet.  We specifically chose a place with a kitchen to save a bit on meals.  I wouldn't have eaten anything prepared in that kitchen much less have fed it to my family.  The stove was disgusting, the counters were sticky, the floor was missing large sections and the cabinets were falling off. There were words painted across the wall in the kitchen graffiti style.  The floor throughout the apartment was hardwood. While I understand that floors crack and separate over time, it was clear that no cleaning had been done in quite some time.  Nails, coins, buttons and much more was down in the very large cracks.  The inner shower curtain was covered in mildew and there was an actual plant growing out of one of the mildewed cracks in the wall around the tub enclosure. The cable and the internet did not function most of the weekend.  We did enjoy the view from the deck but, had to use extreme caution with the very dangerous railing, the broken glass door, the holes on the deck and the 2 bee colonies in the eaves of the roof. The futon in the living room fell apart when we went to use it and we left the pieces on the counter with a note.  I am unclear how this apartment is supposed to be for 5 people, there are accommodations for 4 people max. There were no working fire/smoke alarms in the place.  Finally, on our final night there I sustained 7 spider bites while sleeping, all on my arms and legs.  We were really excited about joining the airbnb community and this has left a terrible taste in our mouths.  We travel 5 or 6 times a year and I guess we will return to hotels."

The only few downfalls were that there was some kind of renovating in the apartment next door so we had power tools waking us up quite early and water shut offs. None of which was Paige's fault, however it was a little frustrating. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper as the road noise outside is extremely loud. "
505,-9,"This was a great location, and having a small store under the apt was perfect; however, this was an extremely negative experience overall. I do understand that the rate for this place is lower than many in this neighborhood and took that into consideration upon review, but the concerns/hassles far outweighed the benefits.  I messaged the owner 5 days prior to arrival to ask if there was any parking included, and there was no response in next 2 days.  I finally called her, and she told me to message her about it again because she has many rentals and her messages often ""get buried"", rather than just answering my quick question over the phone.  Once we were at the apartment, we later noticed that there were many basic extension cords running all over behind the couch.  There were no surge protectors, and no power strips, just primary basic white two prong extension cords, some even plugged into other extension cords.  The air conditioner (three prong plug for a major appliance), was plugged into a 2-prong extension cord, leaving the ground exposed and part of the plastic on that extension cord appeared partially melted around the grounding prong.  These are huge fire hazards and became an immediate concern once discovered.  We were afraid to even plug in our phones/computers in certain areas for fear of overload/fire.  I messaged the owner about this and was told it was not a problem (repeatedly), as she said it was a old house, but that is even more of a reason to ensure there are basic electrical safeguards.  She said she did not understand the problem (repeatedly), and then conveyed I was messaging her too late in the evening because I had to respond repeatedly to explain why it was indeed a large concern.  I was so concerned I took pictures of all of it.  I think the issue is that the owner does not understand electrical concerns (especially in older places), and needs some education on this subject.  We also struggled several times to get into the place from the street, as this doorknob was loose and coming apart.  I brought this to the owners attention as well, and was told they had no issues getting in, so again I felt my legitimate concerns were dismissed.  In addition, the door handle to the bedroom came off several times making it impossible to open it, once locking me inside until friends returned.  The owner promptly acknowledged this specific concern and said she would have it replaced, but by this time we were already quite frustrated with the negative experience.  I have rented places from AirBnB many times in the past, and have never had a negative experience nor have I ever given anyone a negative review.   My hope is that serious fire hazards are not dismissed as something trivial in the future.      "
506,-3,"Gena & Leon were VERY nice people, and I feel bad to give an only okay review, but I think it's important that if you're paying a substantial amount of money to rent a place you know what you're getting!

It seems like maybe prices are much higher in Boston than in other cities, so maybe that's the problem? But we were a little bit disappointed with this rental. For the price we paid, small issues like cold rooms, the ""T"" station being much further away than the ad had led us to believe, a kitchen that was missing a few key things (like salt & pepper, sugar, a frying pan), the inability to lock our apartment from the rest of the house, and some confusion over off-street parking were a bit hard. 

On the plus side, the apartment is very cute, there's a full fridge & oven, and the hosts are very nice with super cute kids! I'm just not sure I would stay here again.

While it is close in proximity to the center of the city as described in the listing, it is also in a very high crime area.  All locals whom we spoke with confirmed this location was in a dangerous area, and we found many articles and crime reports for this area.  We voiced our concerns to the host, as well as to Airbnb, and received no help on the matter.  It was not our intent to offend anyone, but police reports do not often lie.  We will definitely find a different location to rent when returning to Boston with safety as the main concern. "

510,-8,"GOOD:
Nury is a very warm and nice person.
She drove us to return our rental car at the car dealership. We really appreciate that. She gave us a good restaurant recommendation in her area, and was in general very welcoming and friendly.

BAD:
1) The night we checked in, while talking to Nury, we had a large mouse running between us. Unfortunately that issue gave a huge negative twist to our stay. From our conversation with Nury it seems to be an on-going issue at her building. She makes an effort to seal openings and not store garbage in the apartment, but it doesn't seem to remove the problem completely.
It made us use the apartment for as little as possible and very uncomfortable for the time we were there.

2) The bed has a very poor quality spring mattress. We could feel the springs imprint on our body while lying on it and having very weak support. Woke up with a sore back.

3) The place doesn't have Wi-Fi. Since we were traveling from a different country, we rely heavily on Wi-Fi for our internet and communication, and found that to be limiting.

4) Airbnb has a Verified ID badge for Oscar Cruz to build trust. We never met him and he doesn't seem to be the real host. He seems to be a friend of the actual host. It was weird and confusing to understand who is our host.

VALUE:
I usually believe in ""you get what you paid for"".
In this case we spend a total of $275 (CAD) for our 2 nights, with no real value for our money.
It was the most expensive airbnb trip we ever had, yet unfortunately the worst airbnb experience we ever had.

511,-3,"I got to the apartment at midnight and that was not a problem with 24 hour key service. A guy showed up at the door about 10 minutes after I had called and handed me the keys to my room. 

I was also there for an interview. It was a get into Boston and get out kind of trip. My interview went past noon (the usual check-out time), and Tiffany allowed me to leave my things in the room and I ended up leaving at 3pm with no fuss.

The room was awesome. Bigger than most of my college dorm rooms. It had a microwave, sink, tv, and an iron. Internet was painfully slow though. The apartment is also walking distance from everything in Downtown Boston. Definitely would recommend this place over other Boston airbnb's!"

My son, who also stayed at the apartment, arrived a day earlier and met with Will.  He tells me check-in was simple.

Je recommande vivement cet appartement et je le louerai à nouveau des que je reviendrai à Boston!"
515,-8,"In short: poor communication, unhygienic and dirty, electricity issues and unexpected surge pricing.

While I had always had great experiences with Airbnb, the experience with Josefa was horrible. My complaints start with unexpected surge pricing and continue with every aspect of the experience

While Josefa advertises her room for $69, when I filled the application the price changed to $87. I asked her about this change and she told me that the price depends on the day. But when I checked the price on Airbnb the next day, the website still listed it at $69. Very suspicious surge pricing.

The poor communication continues to my arrival: I wrote Josefa my arriving time at Boston and she said it would be no problem. However, when I landed in Boston at 3pm and was in the taxi she sent me a message that neither she nor her daughter were home. The daughter’s boyfriend could let me in after 5pm. I had to change my plans and wait. This was already a red flag. 

Alex, the very kind boyfriend, let me in. But then the room had some cleanliness issues: the bed looked like somebody had slept in it already and the sheets had stains. Since now it was 9 pm, I had no choice but to sleep in there. The room was cold and drafty, so the next day I asked for blankets – but the ones I received also looked like have not been laundered. This raises serious hygiene concerns.

But it get’s worse: next day there was an electricity outage in my room, and the only way to get any light was to get an extension cord from one of the rooms to mine, so that I could have one lamp. Connecting the cords, I looked on the floor and wished I hadn’t. A lot of dust. Wonder what the $50 cleaning fee is for?! The long cord was also a tripping hazard.

Neither Josepha nor her daughter – who arrived in the middle of the night but hardly spoke with me - ever bothered to ask how my experience was, or to apologize for the fact that I was without electricity. There was clearly no interest in being a good host.

In conclusion, the experience was terrible: bad communication, a drafty and dirty room, and no electricity. The host was dishonest about the price, and disinterested in my experience.

The only positive sign was the dog and the daughter’s boyfriend, Alex, who was polite and nice and tried his best."
516,-3,"Apartment as advertised. Had a problem with the keys but Flatbook were very responsive and resolved the issue quick. 

The bedroom looks out onto a highway & train tracks so there is a bit of noise - be warned."
517,-2,"We would definitely stay here again.  It was about a mile from the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion and close to the T station; so it met our needs.  Ellen communicated with us related to any questions we had.  My impression was this was an AirB&B rental only, as when I called she clarified if I was referring to the Boston apartment.  This didn't bother me, but was different than my past AirB&B experiences.  She also let us know that there were other people staying in the other rooms, which I greatly (URL HIDDEN) I would want to know if I were there alone.  We saw one other guest (once) when we were both coming home.  

I had one issue in the upstairs bathroom.  The summary information specifically said not to use the upstairs shower portion of the tub.   About 3/4 into my bath I realized that water was coming out of the shower nozzle (it was hooked to the water spout so it wasn't impacting my bath).  I ignored it as I thought perhaps it had been fixed or I had read the information incorrectly.   When I got out of the bath the floor was pretty wet...towel, bath mat, clothes, etc.  There was a baking pan under the tub, I suspect to catch runoff (it obviously was full).  I had my partner bring in an extra towel...but if my partner wasn't there  I would have been left with uncomfortable options.  This wasn't a big deal for me, but for others I suggest you check  that the shower is indeed turned off prior to filling up your tub!

It was also a bit noisy, but it didn't keep me awake.  The central air was nice!  It was hot upstairs when we got there but Ellen made sure to tell us to make it conformable.    

We didn't even need to use the parking garage as we found free street parking closer.  

As I said, overall, good experience.  Be sure to check your email, as that is where Ellen will send the codes to get in the apartment door shortly before your check-in time.

Den Gastgeber haben wir persönlich nicht kennengelernt, die Kommunikation klappte aber reibungslos über SMS bzw. Mail. Man muß allerdings beachten, dass die Wohnung im 5. Obergeschoss über eine recht schmale, steile Treppe zu erreichen ist, was bei schwerem Gepäck ein Kraftakt sein kann. Wir haben dies bewältigt und wurden dafür mit einer hellen Unterkunft mit tollen Blick empfangen. "
519,-1,"The good: Location 

The bad: The apartment could use a significant overhaul in terms of decor, amenities, towels, etc. The bathroom is ridiculously small and cramped.  I'm only 5'9"" and I could hardly move in the shower.  The wifi seemed to go in and out as well.  Very annoying for a business trip.

The odd: I get that not all neighbors love an Airbnb neighbor. However, I'm a very respectful person and sending me reminders about being quiet, not buzzing the neighbor's doorbell, changing the location of the lockbox, etc. makes me feel as if I'm doing something illegal.

520,-4,"The good, the bad and the ugly...... first the good.    Good location in Beacon Hill close to offices and only a few blocks from Whole Foods for dinner choices each night.  Nice replacement windows.
Now the bad.   Host is not on site.   Keys are obtained from a lock box 1 1/2 blocks away, so be prepared to lug your luggage around a bit before you gain entry. (in the dark, and the rain)   Upon arrival, apartment smelled of stale cooking odors (garlic) and old cologne.  Main bedroom was really bad so I had to sleep on fold out couch in living room where smells weren't as bad.   Lights in bathroom didn't work (first switch I tried upon arriving) had to shower by flashlight.  No wash cloths available, just hand towels and bath towels.  Air conditioning doesn't work, so apartment was too hot and humid.  Sheets are 100% polyester so you will sweat even more when laying on top of them. No closet space to hang any suits or dresses.  Main hallway to apartments smells of cigarette and marijuana smoke.  Bannister and stair railings are greasy feeling but you have to use them when climbing the 3 flights of stairs to the apartment. 
The ugly.... 2x4 barricade to secure the entry door. "
521,-5,"We survived one night in this sad little place. The unit is up four flights of very steep stairs in a very tight stairwell, so get ready for a workout with suitcases! When you turn on the sink in the bathroom, it sounds like someone is jackhammering. The jackhammer sound will also come on spontaneously and intermittently  and was a most unpleasant early alarm part-way through the night. There is one small window AC unit, which is barely ample for the room it's in and absolutely useless for the extra bedroom down the hall. This room was like an oven. There is a circulating floor fan in that room, but it was broken. The towel holder in the bathroom is barely hanging on, which you'll discover if you place a hand towel there as the rack falls off the wall. And now, let's talk about the key entry situation: you have to walk more than a block and a half around the corner and down the street to find the lock box to be able to get into the apartment. Instructions say that there is a green key in the lock box, but there is no green key. Informed the owner of the property that there was no green key, and he replied (much later) that there is a key with a green dot. There is no green dot on either key. It's not really that big a deal once you figure it out, but it is unsettling to arrive at a place, go through the hassle of getting into the lock box which is not directly at the property, only to find that the green key described is not in the lock box. I would not recommend this place, unless you absolutely have no other option!"
522,-7,"The area was pretty good. It was really convenient to have the whole foods connected next door. It was close enough to tuff's medical station exit that you could get anywhere easily via train.

The size was slightly smaller than expected. I thought there would be three beds and a couch, but one bed is the pull out couch which made it super crammed at night and morning time. The blanket that came with the couch had blood or poop on it... Did not want to figure out which but it was, disgusting. The bathrooms were oddly huge though. 

Biggest complaint was the AC was separate in two parts of the house and one unit was broken making one of the two bedrooms a hot box (80+ degrees inside). It was really only bad for two of the five days we were there as the other days were colder but required the window to be open which lead to street sweepers scaring the crap out of you in the middle of the night. I did contact Josh to fix the problem which he did respond. He said if it continues he'll fix it, which of course it was going to continue but since colder days were ahead I didn't want to bother having repair people over. I'd give it 4/5 stars if this wasn't an issue but it really pissed off the couple that got stuck sleeping there and the couple that got stuck on the couch bed. They had to rotate just deal with it.

It had a gym on the basement level which was nice and construction is currently going on across the street, but it was minimal noise overall. The front desk people were nice in block 3, but rude as hell in block 1 (accident went there first). They also are very strict about the 4 a clock time frame which was a little annoying flying in with 6 things of luggage and waiting 45 minutes for no reason. I understand that i was told this prior though and I do believe they contacted Josh and they let us in slightly early.

I would have picked another place knowing the AC was an issue but hopefully it will be fixed soon."
523,-4,"The reservation was really simple and Shawn was answering very quickly. We had no difficulty to find the keys and the place. The place was a bit dirty (dust, doors were damaged, etc.) and the location was very noisy on Friday night. But the place was very well located, 30sec from the subway station."
524,-2,"communication via e-mail was ok. 
location is indeed very close to the subway station
minor points were:
the pictures did pretend the place was much bigger. In fact this was a really small appartment and not suited for more than 3 persons.
cleaning was not ok: the oven in the kitchen was very dirty "
525,-2,"Rebecca was great, my flight was extremely delayed and she was able to accommodate my arrival times with no issues.

The apartment is very cute and comfortable, however be aware that it faces the street and there was very loud street noise and noise within the building. It was not an issue on Monday night, but Saturday and Sunday night (Monday was a holiday) were extremely loud all night long. "
526,-1,"Lita was very accommodating regarding our arrival, which unfortunately was delayed by several hours due to air travel issues. The house was neat and just as pictured. Our guests loved the place and will definitely be staying here again when they return."
527,-1,"Alles war fein, der Jonathan versuchte mehrmals, uns persönlich zu erreichen, leider haben wir uns verpasst. Die Nachbarschaft hat uns gefallen, eine gute Alternative zur Hektik von New York. Wer kein Problem damit hat, die Unterkunft mit anderen Kurzzeit-Gästen zu teilen - für den ist das stylische Zimmer mit Bad ein guter Deal!"
528,-2,"The apartment lived up to the description. Sebastien was very accommodating with meeting me, I was running later than expected due to traffic but he had no problem waiting for me. The location is definitely the best part, you are real close (a short walk) to plenty of shops, restaurants, and other attractions. The T (train/subway) station is also very close. Parking can be difficult, you're in a prime location in a busy city so it is expected, but make sure to do your research of where to park to help limit the cost. The apartment was everything I was hoping for when I booked it."
529,-4,"This was the worst experience I have ever had using AirBnb. Upon arrival at the apartment I noticed it was dirty throughout and not as clean and new as the pictures depict. There was broken furniture, the white couch was stained and the bathroom was dirty (and the sink drain didn't work). There were also dirty/wet towels hanging in the bathroom and the whole apartment smelled of cologne. Very disappointing.

Sebastian was nice, but unfortunately these were not things that could be fixed to make my short 3 day stay comfortable.

For the amount charged, I expected the place to be in good/excellent condition."
530,-1,"Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen.  Nachdem Bernardo uns vorgängig genau erklärt hatte wie man vom Flughafen  mit Bus und U-Bahn ins hübsche Quartier Beacon Hill gelangt, haben wir die Unterkunft problemlos erreicht. DasAppartement ist sehr günstig und ruhig gelegen. In der Umgebung befinden sich Restaurants und Geschäfte für jeden Geschmack. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind prolemlos zu Fuss erreichbar. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Boston rundum genossen. Das gemütliche und sehr gechmackvoll eingerichtete Appartement und die Möglichkeit sich zu verpflegen ohne ausgehen zu müssen haben wir sehr geschätzt."
531,-1,"Absolutely great location, and Everett (Jessica's bf) was very nice. But... 

The apartment we stayed in was not the one shown. The one we stayed in was obviously not lived in and there were several problems with it. The toilet wouldn't flush and couldn't be fixed during our stay. It also wasn't fixed to the ground. The cable socket wasn't fixed to the wall. The curtains in the living room didn't fit, and fell down when we tried to draw them. That wouldn't matter so much, but the living room faces directly onto the street at ground level, and one of our party was sleeping on the couch, so there was zero privacy for her. The fridge freezer wasn't clean, and the floors were dusty. There were none of the little amenities that make airbnb stays special - no soap, shampoo, hairdryer, iron etc (though Everett did lend us his steamer on request). 

Nice host, great location, but not the apartment is not cared for and the issues made it a bit of a crunchy stay. "
532,-2,"While the pictures accurately reflect the apartment, and the hosts were very easy to communicate with, we had a poor experience in this apartment for the following reasons.
1. The key was not at the apartment at check-in, we had to wait a short time.
2. The toilet was clogged upon arrival, and the janitor had to come two times before it was fixed. Even then, flushing was slow. We were told that NO toilet paper could be placed in the toilet at all. If we had been notified of this in advance, we would not have stayed here.
3. The internal doors of the apartment lock automatically, and no key or note is provided. My son was locked in a room alone until the janitor could break the door open.
4. There was not a top sheet on the beds, and no washable cover on the duvets; this is not sanitary from guest to guest.
5. The apartment was not thoroughly cleaned, stained and dirty shower, old food left in fridge, some unclean glasses in the cabinets.
6. One of the kitchen outlets ruined a new Kindle that I purchased less than 10 days prior to our stay.

I appreciate and believe that the hosts are trying to provide a good experience, and this is a good price for a rental in Boston, but I would not stay here again due to cleanliness and the number of problems we experienced. The parking is off-street, which is nice."
533,-1,"We felt very welcomed. Our flight was delayed and the hosts checked on us to make we're OK. When we got there, there were pastries, orange juice, and milk waiting for us. The apartment was was stocked with everything we needed."
534,-7,"My friends and I stayed in this apartment from Sept 6 to 9th and I am NOT recommending it! I have reported this complaint to Airbnb as Heriberto did not respond to my concerns.
We had a number of concerns related to safety and cleanliness.
- the fridge was leaking and we reported it to H and he said he had someone in fixing it ""yesterday"". After wiping up the water from the kitchen floor, the paper towels were filthy and still were the second day we had to wipe up. When was this floor last mopped????
- there were NO top sheets on the queen and double beds and the comforters are shabby (I now see that someone has complained about this previously). So, why did this happen again?
- the kitchen table was filthy and not wiped off clean
- the bathtub/shower was small but that was ok. The tub however was so rusted grrrrrr. Thankfully they bought a shower mat after I mentioned the state of the tub
- the fabric on the kitchen chairs and the ones in the living room are very old/grungy and I didn't want to sit on them.

In terms of safety .....
- The fire escape is almost totally blocked by the fridge and once we did open the door the escape route is cluttered with stuff
- the electrical/hydro panel outside of the house broke away from the house and was suspended, hanging 2 feet way from the house. Thank goodness there was no fire as this posed a serious fire hazard.
- the entrance to the apartment involved negotiating several steps and the hanging and swinging outside door was not stabilized so that made it difficult to hold on and get inside (not good for someone in a cast who had to hang on).

So, I have asked the host for a discount on our stay and he has ignored me for the past week. Airbnb is now involved in resolving this complaint and my feeling is, don't be fooled by cheap prices.

"
535,-3,"As previously Advised in email 2nd Oct we were unable to remain at the premises due To extreme access difficulties and left the same day. We did not feel safe in the neighbourhood and did not have any cell phone reception together with considerable able walking distances to public transport. We felt very isolated. This was not made aparrent in the initial airbnb advertising of the property. Finally the flat was shabby and was over priced for the internal and external condition.

536,-2,"Heriberto obliged my party to drop our luggage in prior to the official check-in time which we are thankful for. . Both Heriberto and Cathy were quick to respond to the minor issues we had. Breakfast pastry, bottled water ,orange juice and bananas were waiting for us later. The neighbourhood especially around the public transport station is questionable. We saw housing projects  close to the T station. We walked very briskly to the (URL HIDDEN) Friday night there was noisy revellers who we assumed were coming home after their evening out.The laundry facility are in the basement but we did not have the need to utilise the washer and dryer.


"
537,-1,"The host was wonderful and communicative.  The apt is a bit old and dirty as mentioned on a few reviews.  

The paper towels had insect dirt and bathroom has a distinct smell.  The cleaniness is a biggest holdback and we couldn't get the wifi to work.  "
538,-1,Apartment was freazing cold and the wifi didn't work. But it was very cheap. You get what you pay for.
539,-1,"It was easy to find, easy to park a car, the key was in the lockbox. The location is very good, short walk to metro station, few stations from Boston downtown. Heriberto prepared some pastry and fruits for breakfast, which was so nice from him. The only downside were the locks and doors. Main house door lock is so difficult to unlock, we arrived late night and I was worry we will not be able to enter the house. Appartment doors and lock are so weak, one kick could open it. But the neighbourhood was fine, we didn' t feel unsafe."
540,-2,"We spent very little time at the accommodation as we were touring, but found walking through an untidy bedroom to our bedroom unpleasant. The hosts did not show us the amenities we could use eg the kitchen and laundry. Even though we tried to initiate conversation with our hosts, there was no response, generally an unfriendly atmosphere."
541,-2,"Although in a really good location, we had a couple of issues with this place.  Firstly the doors to the apartment aren't numbered so its difficult to know which one in the block it is.

Secondly the bed has to be the most uncomfortable I've ever slept in, complete with a waterproof bottom sheet.

The place is a decent size, but could do with a little tlc, such as fixing the broken lamps."
542,-1,"The apartment couldn't be in a more central location if you want to see historical Boston, the front door is literally  yards from the freedom trail and north end church! It is about a 5min walk to either Haymarket or North T station so very easy to get around. No problems with the apartment in itself, clean when we arrived and no issues getting the keys.  Small flight of stairs up to the front door but only challenging if extremely unfit, a couple in their fifties were in the flat above ours and had no problems. If there are two of you in the double bed and one is a light sleeper beware, it's very squeaky! Would definitely recommend as a great place to stay whilst in Boston and hope to use it again."
543,-3,"It's tricky to find this loft: there's a lot of buildings alike and it is located at the end of and alley. The building itself is very antique, however it has its charm and the host has left it perfectly clean and a lovely scent in the air. There were two things in this flat that has annoyed me: the distance from major public transport and all the noise that were made inside the flat and from the store above. This last issue really troubles me! Despite those issues, the flat offers a cosy place to crash in."
544,-1,"Nous avons trouvé facilement l'appartement. Celui-ci est situé dans un quartier sympa, animé sans être trop bruyant. beaucoup de restaurants et de petites supérettes.
Le quartier nous a beaucoup plus.
seul bémol, il n'y a pas de métro pour le centre de Boston dans le North End. C'est pas grave on marche dans ces cas là.
L'appartement correspondait parfaitement aux photos.
un seul regret le ménage ! l'appartement était sale !  j'ai du faire le ménage dans la cuisine, et les sols méritaient bien un coup d'aspirateur aussi mais il n'y en avait pas. j'ai retrouvé sur le sol dans la chambre une gélule de médicament ! ! ! ce qui est loin de m'avoir plus car nous étions avec une petite fille d'à peine 2 ans ! elle aurait pu l'avaler.
en terme de vaisselle, seulement 2 assiettes et pas de petites cuillères.
"
545,-1,"This was so central, we were walking distance from everything we wanted to do! Jose was very responsive with everything. The only cons were that the floors were creaky and loud and if there are people staying on other floors, you will hear them. It was half the price of a hotel, so a huge plus in my book!"
546,-1,"I was very disappointed with the presentation of the place when we arrived despite arriving after our check in time of 2pm. The place was cleaned within a few hours, however. "
547,-1,"If you are interested in reliving your days as a struggling young adult, this is the place for you – stained tub, moldy grout, uneven floors with nails sticking out, broken blinds, and a baseboard heater falling off the wall that is full of dust. This place needs a very deep cleaning and home repairs. We definitely did not want to spend any time in this dark space other than to sleep. 
(URL HIDDEN)
And, no, we do not have high expectations, as we live in a 1908 building in the 3rd largest US city with a 1950s kitchen and bath. We understand and appreciate vintage. We enjoy camping and regularly stay in non-traditional accommodations throughout the world. This space is definitely on my list of, “what the...?!” 
 
The positives: The location was wonderful – on the Freedom Trail and in the North End. Jose/Jason was quick to respond and accommodated a late check-out. 
"
548,-1,Logement situe dans un quartier central permettant la visite de Boston a pied En plus le fait d'avoir une terrasse nous a permis de prendre les repas tout en profitant du soleil et de la belle vue 
549,-2,"That's a good place although my friend and I failed to meet the host, but only one problem is the host didn't provide the comforter and I have to take my sleeping bag for my friend. You know it's kind of cold days cause the rainy day...but host sent the pajama to her"
550,-2,"She was very nice, but there was no wifi there :(
Kind of a far walk from the station, but close by uber
A little bit of a strange smell when I first got in
Dirty"
551,-1,"Bad experience for a family of 4 adults. The description and photos let us think that the couch (queen/full pullout couch in the description) was in the living room but it happens to be in the bedroom since there is only one room! The couch is particularly uncomfortable for 2 adults. Only 2 chairs around the table, while the description states that the apartment can accommodate up to 4 persons. The bathroom was barely clean and the place is particularly noisy (just a few meters from the highway). "
552,-1,"We did not meet the host in person.
The black banana and the vase of dead flowers on the rickety black wooden table were a metaphor for our experience."
553,-1,"C'est un petit studio qui se situe a 5 minutes de marche du Fenway Park! Un studio avec le strict nécessaire pour y passer la nuit. Nous étions 4 adulte, donc un lit double et un sofa-lit pas top-confo .Côté propreté c'est passable. Et on a eu besoin d'appeler l'hôte quand nous sommes arrivés sur place, car il avait nous n'avions aucune idée du numéro de porte rendu à l'intérieur du bâtiment...Un numéro de porte sur la clé aurait été plus simple et efficace... "
554,-2,"Nous avons occupé le studio de Sean avec nos 2 enfants durant 4 jours.  

Points positifs :
-  Studio très bien placé pour visiter les sites principaux de Boston à pied. 40/45 min de marche jusqu'au waterfront. 40/45 min de marche jusqu'à Harvard. Sinon, le métro est à moins de 5 min à pied. 
- Sean s'est montré très réactif à nos appels (il s'est déplacé pour nous aider à trouver la lockbox, puis a réglé en quelques heures notre problème de connexion à Internet). 

Points négatifs :
- L'appartement n'était pas propre à notre arrivée (beaucoup de poussière). Ce point a déjà été signalé dans plusieurs commentaires et le ménage est pourtant compris dans le prix !
- La cuisine manque d'équipements pour 4 personnes : grandes assiettes, fourchettes et grande poêle notamment permettraient de prendre un minimum de repas pendant 4 jours. 
- Enfin, le studio est très bruyant : la 4 voies est très proche et de jour comme de nuit, la circulation ne s'arrête jamais ! Au bout de 4 jours, le bruit nous est devenu insupportable...

Ces points négatifs ne nous ont pas empêchés de passer un très agréable séjour à Boston. Nous avons tout simplement adoré cette ville !"
555,-5,"We didn't particularly feel welcomed. We were at least able to get into the apartment after tracking down the key. The place was not as described. ..old and dingy, smell of fried meat permeated the place, plaster coming loose in the bathroom, generally uncomfortable. No bed bugs, roaches or rats though. When we texted about wifi access, we got no response. The neighborhood was ok, but, after listening to one of the upstairs neighbors scream for an hour in the middle of the night, we decided we had enough and left a day early."
556,-1,Communication was an issue for some reason. It could have been the app. I didn't receive the apartment number until after we arrived and had to wait a while for that information. I'm not sure the premed is allows for this type of service so that was a bit of a concern. The place was as described and in an excellent location. 
557,-2,"Got off to a rocky start... Sean accidentally told us the wrong apartment so we were had to hang around a bit until it was sorted. Accidents happen - human error. The previous occupants sheets were changed at 8.30 which interfered with our plans a little. I'd agree with some of the other comments about cleanliness... The whole place could do with a dust and a vacuum, but the bed was clean and the bathroom usable. If you're looking for somewhere to crash at night and dump your stuff it's great - easy walk into centre of Boston and lots of nearby restaurants. Great communication with Sean."
558,-1,"This place was a nice budget friendly place to stay, though the apartment was a bit old and dusty. The whole key on the fence down the block thing was a bit strange and I would have had trouble finding it had Sean not been there."
559,-1,"Our experience was amazing.  Finding the key box was a little difficult at fist because we were a bit turned around, but after that our stay was amazing!  Location was in view of Fenway which was amazing!  You can briefly hear the game when taking a shower! Fun experience and I would be interested in booking with Sean on my next trip to Boston!"
560,-2,"It was a great location and an adorable studio. We loved being able to see Fenway from the window, but not too much traffic noise, considering the location. Parking was a little tricky, but once we found a place we didn't need to move the car again. 
(The pullout couch was a little rough, but we found extra padding in the closet which made it much more bearable. For the price it's hard to complain) "
561,-1,Tout était très bien. L'accès à l'appartement était simple. Nous n'avons eu aucun problème à le trouver. L'appartement était très propre et le quartier vraiment bien. Nous n'avons pas eu de problème à se stationner comme la saison des Red Sox était terminée. 
562,-1,Sean's apartment was exactly what we expected from our stay there a year ago. It is a great place to spend the night though the traffic noise was a little louder than what we remembered but nothing that woke us up in the night. 
563,-1,"The space is unbalanced, with the main living/bedroom surrounded by a small bathroom and a ridiculously small kitchen where the oven door and the refrigerator door can't be fully opened because of each other. Also the choice of adding a round table for 4 people in such a small space is questionable. The location is great if you want to attend baseball games at Fenway Park which is indeed a block away, but so is a large entertainment complex whose visitors can make some noise in the street on week-end evenings.

Sean was really helpful to meet our needs as we were travelling with a toddler and provided a pack-and-play crib and a wooden model train for us to use, but the kitchen lacked some utensils like a bread knife and we felt shortchanged on towels since we were provided only two bath towels, and no hand towels for the kitchen or the bathroom.

On the whole, it was good enough for what we needed, which was a quick stop on our way back to New York from Maine."
564,-5,"Sean was very quick to respond to all requests & questions.  However, he gave me incorrect information (lock box code) which led to a very traumatic experience for my daughter (16) and I who were freezing, out of batteries on all of our mobile devices and were in desperate need of shelter.  When we were eventually able to get some charge to our phone, we called and Sean responded immediately bringing the keys to us.  

However, I never received an apology for this mistake which led to an experience that has totally changed my desire to rent an airbnb in the middle of a big city, where you need to figure out where to park your car.  If Sean had told me that I could have pulled up in front of the building, drop my stuff off, get the key & then park the car - this unfortunate situation would have been avoided.  I would have known before I parked my car a distance away and ventured out into the cold that I had the wrong code.

Besides this situation, you get what you pay for.  The apartment was adequate but lacking in some very basic needs/comfort items such as paper towels, shampoo, wash cloths, top sheet on the bed & had old food in the fridge.  It's very run down and didn't seem super clean.

I NEVER give bad reviews and I don't feel fantastic about doing it  - but it's the truth and everyone considering this place should know.  If you go in the winter - DOUBLE CHECK WITH SEAN THAT YOU HAVE THE CURRENT LOCK BOX CODE.  "
565,-5,"I could not travel, but my friend stayed there, so this is his description: My stay in Sean department  was awful. There is a special way of entering the   key because the lock is from the 18th century and he never told me anything. 
Tried to open the door and bend the key.When I called him for a new key and help he didn't help us at all. He was very angry and said that I had to hurry to pick up the key from his  house because he was busy.
Old building, dirty, the AC makes a lot of noise, and the worst is that the host has no intention to recieve anyone or explain anything. "
566,-1,"Pros:
Price!!!!!
View of Fenway
The toy train tracks (we have 2 boys, and it helped a lot, especially with the absence of a tv)
Location
Sean, himself.  When we checked in, there was an issue we had for which he provided a resolution in a timely manner

Cons
The place is extremely worn and very tired.
Super dusty.

Overall, if returning to Boston, I would see if there was something in better condition for a little more money, but if there wasn't, I might book here again because of the price and location."
567,-1,"Our host was taken seriously ill just before our scheduled arrival time, and thus was not able to set us in, so we had to make alternate arrangements for our lodging. This was of course through NO fault of our host."
568,-5,"Unpleasant. The dirty clothes stuffed under the chair, the overabundance of stuff pouring out of a closet, the profanity displayed on the walls, no top sheet under a quilt that, who knows if it was clean, the lack of bed pillows, the mis-matched and stained towels, the street construction not allowing me to park my car anywhere nearby, the mosquitos, it being more of a dorm room set-up extended into a rabbit warren of a dark underground basement. It sucked."
569,-1,"Communication was lacking. I contacted host 2 days prior arriving. I only heard back from him with instructions on how to get access a couple of hours prior to check in on day of arrival. It made me feel like  I should look at an emergency last minute hotel. The place was what I expected based on the description- a little dingy, but with the essentials.  The location and proximity to Fenway, rail and places of interest is great. Overall, I would rate the experience as a C-.  If communication was better it would have been a B. When I left, I forgot to return the key to the lockbox and had to leave it with a nearby shopowner. I truly do feel bad about that and for the inconvenience I caused the cleaning personnel. "
570,-2,"Unfortunately, probably due to an error in communication, nobody was waiting for us on our arrival at the apartment and could not gain access to it. We had sent a mail to Mr. Lance the day before, confirming our arrival in the afternoon and we received an automatically generated answer. As nobody showed, we had to wait a long time and only thanks to some neighbours, who knew Mr. Lance and could therefore find a second key, we managed to get in. The day after we received a mail from Mr. Lance, saying that we should have received, months ago, a mail containing all instructions as to where we could find the key, ecc. We never received it, and when we asked him to re-send it with the original date, he could not find it. So something went wrong in the communication; anyway we solved the problem and Mr. Lance apologized for the inconvenient.
As far as the apartment concerns, we can say that it's very nice, clean, confortable and furnished with good taste. What annoyed us, anyway, was the sleeping accommotations. The apartment was said to have 6 sleeping accommotations. We had pointed out that we were 6 adults. Actually the sleeping accommodations are 5: there are two bedrooms with a Queenbed in each, another room with a sofa-bed for one person or max . for two small children. So one friend of us had to sleep on an uncorfortable sofa in the dining room. The table and the chairs were for 4 people only.
"
571,-1,"The ""apartment"" is actually a basement, pretty shabby for the price. There were two dirty towels left in the bathroom (with brown fingermarks). Interior is ok, host was ok."
572,-3,"Jose was great about allowing us to show up early to drop our things off before a day of exploring in Boston.  The location is great as others have noted.

I'd be remiss if I didn't note a few of the cons that others have mentioned:
The bed is not very comfortable and is located directly under the stairs (you can see them in the top right of the main photo) and main hallway into the building, which was noisy late at night and in the morning.
There were several burned out lights, and this being a basement apartment it can feel a bit creepy - that certainly didn't help.
There's an AC and dehumidifier.  They are both very loud.  The dehumidifier beeps when it's full - empty it before you go to bed so it doesn't wake you up.
The cleaning and service fees brought the cost to over $200, which is a lot for a dark basement apartment.  I get that it's a location thing (historic Boston, summer, Sunday night) - but just offering a buyer beware comment.

All in all, can't say I would recommend staying here unless you're looking at it solely for the location.  It's an old basement apartment that shows its age."
573,-1,Jose's place did just the trick while we were visiting Boston for a wedding. You can't beat the price for the location - it was awesome stepping out every day and seeing the Old North Church and walking the streets of Little Italy. The ONLY downside was that you can hear the upstairs neighbor in the morning walking around but I would still stay here again! 
574,-1,"We stayed in Jeff's apartment for three nights this week. The apartment listing was accurate. The location was terrific and the Airbnb representative met us on time to deliver the keys. The apartment was mostly great. Our only major complaint was the smell coming from the sink that several others mentioned in earlier reviews. There were a few deodorizers placed around the sink, but the entire kitchen/living area still smelled rather strongly of mold. The other smaller problem, was that the main light in the bathroom could not be used. When left on for more than a minute, the fan rumbled loudly. Other than that, the apartment was as advertised. We enjoyed the Kind bars, water and local chocolate left for us. The manual was very helpful and included local restaurants, sights to visit, etc. The apartment was pretty noisy at night (from street noises), but the central location made up for it. We enjoyed our stay. "
575,-1,"Logement bien situé en plein cœur du centre d'affaires de Boston. Nous avons tout fait à pied. Déçu par cette expérience qui va à l'encontre du concept Airbnb. De plus, le canapé convertible est très inconfortable et le matelas était très sale. En revanche, nos bagages ont pu être stockés dans un endroit sécurisé pour le restant de la journée de notre départ. "
576,-5,"The location of the apartment is excellent, but the whole experience was the worst we have ever had using AirBnB. As soon as we arrived we had some issues. There were strong fresh paint fumes, the window blinds were impossible to operate, and Internet stopped working. Our request for help was not answered. The following day we found that the bed frame was in the brink of falling apart. That request was taken care quickly, but the person that fixed it leaved the apartment filthy, with screws and wood shavings all over the place. And then the boiler of the building broke down on a Friday morning, and we were without hot water and heating for the rest of our stay (4 full days and nights). This was in the middle of a snow storm. We were offered to use the shower of a different apartment building on Monday, three days after the problem began. And finally we got a partial refund of only 50% of the days we were without heating. A truly terrible experience."
577,-1,Mon séjour chez Andreina c'est bien passé. Tout est propre et en ordre.
578,-1,"Jeff a été très accueillant à notre arrivée, il nous a même aidé à porter nos valises jusqu'au 3ème étage et nous a donné une carte de métro. Les deux autres personnes qui habitaient l'appartement étaient très sympathiques. On s'est senti comme ""à la maison"". 
Le seul réel problème était la propreté ! dormir avec de la poussière derrière et tout autour du lit est très désagréable. La taille de la chambre ne permettait pas de poser nos valises, de plus celle-ci était très mal rangé ! beaucoup de choses au sol, sous le lit et sur l'unique meuble qui permettrait aux voyageurs de poser des choses. La salle de bain n'était pas très propre non plus. Mais en dehors de ces choses concernant la propreté, la localisation de l'appartement est très bien et nous avons été bien reçu malgré tout. "
579,-3,"Sarah seemed to be a nice, friendly host when I met her... Unfortunately I encountered some issues with the apartment and my stay. My check-in time was agreed upon at 4pm. I arrived at 5 to a room with dirty towels, bedding, and dishes. Sarah did evenyually arrive and clean, I was finally in my room at 6:15pm, with no real apology, it seemed she had another commitment (no emergency) and didn't bother to call or contact me to let me know. The apartment room itself were disappointing and felt unsafe. My bedroom had a door with only a tiny doorknob lock -opening to an open alley. The room included one bright overhead light, a bed (with a plastic noisy cover over mattress), and a folding tray table with the plastic wrapping still on. The bathroom had a tiny stream of water and a broken shower door that didn't close. In the kitchen I saw rat traps... It just seemed like an unsafe area and uncomfortable room, that I would not recommend."
580,-1,I needed a room unexpectedly for 2 nights and Sarah responded. 
581,-2,"The place itself was exactly what my girlfriend and I were looking for - a modest place to lay our heads at night. The bed was comfy and the room was well kept. Only complaint about the room itself would be the bathroom - the shower door was hanging off and overall the bathroom could be spruced up a bit. 

What really detracted from our experience was the lack of communication shown by the host. I sent a message a week before our trip to plan out meeting/key exchange details, but never got a reply back. I sent another message about 2 days before leaving, and did not get a reply back until my girlfriend and I were on our way to Boston via bus. This forced us to move around our plans for the day as we had to wait until 4 to check in (again, not a big deal if we could have planned for this).  

There was also a mix up with the key in the lockbox. We had no idea that there would be other Air B n B'ers staying at the apartment at the same time as us, so we took the key with us while exploring the town. I get a message from the host while at the Red Sox game demanding us to open the door for the other guests and/or return the key ASAP or pay for the other room. She was somewhat aggressive over the phone, especially for the first time speaking to her guests. We told her we did not want to leave the game as we had just gotten there and it was the whole reason for our trip and that we would compensate her for the guests that she lost. 

I want to preface this by saying that we accept responsibility for the mix up, as she did note to return the keys immediately to the lockbox in the message she finally sent us back. However, we thought she meant AFTER our stay. Again, I accept responsibility for this but this all could have been avoiding by clearer communication.  Just a little frustrating that the only time we could easily get in contact with her was when she needed to reach us. 
"
582,-1,"Appartement décevant, passez votre chemin. A 55e par jour, nous nous attendions à trouver un endroit propre. Or la chambre, à notre arrivée, était sale. Les draps limite propres, des restes sous le lit. La salle de bain ""privative"" est inutilisable et dans un état de delabrement avancé. L'autre salle de bain commune aux autres habitants était tellement crasseuse que nous devions nous doucher en claquette. 
Seules les parties communes sont assez propres. Nous avons été deçu car cette annonce apparaissait comme annonce Flash airbnb. Malgré tout, si vous n'avez pas vraiment d'hygiène, la maison est à proximité de la station de bus Dudley square, qui amene directement en ville. Ca reste quand meme dans la banlieu reculé de Boston mais au moins vous pouvez facilement y garer votre voiture de location."
583,-1,"Wir hatten ein großes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad. Die Wohnung war sauber und zu Fuß max fünf Minuten bis zu den Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gelegen. Sarah hat uns die Schlüssel hinterlegt, da sie arbeiten musste, ist aber nach der Arbeit vorbei gekommen und hat uns herzlich willkommen geheißen, sie ist eine wirklich nette und herzliche Person."
584,-1,Sarah is very responsive to any questions and concerns for the stay. And she came over within minutes when I was unable to decipher her instructions to find the lock and keys when I arrived at her place.
585,-1,"Good place to stay. The apartment is close to a bus station that can take you everywere.
The bathroom is really good and the kitchen has everything you need. 
One thing: I think is a bit expensive, but on the other hand there are no cheap plases in Boston...
Overall, would stay again."
586,-1,"This place looked amazing and was very clean. I enjoyed my stay here in Back Bay. The only issue we had was the A/C was broken / being replaced. We did not know this when we signed up so we had to find out the hard way. We spent over an hour trying to figure out if we were configuring the A/C wrong. Waiting and hoping the cool air would start flow. After waiting for a reply from the host. We found out that the A/C was being replaced. It was a very hot and humid the first day in Boston. After that it cooled down so it wasn't that bad. But if we new the A/C was out, i would have book somewhere else. So other than the A/C issue it was a good stay."
587,-1,"When we checked the room with the host, we found that the room slightly smelled of smoke. We requested to be transferred and he did that immediately. We had a private bathroom in the new room and it was also more spacious. "
588,-2,I was welcomed into the home and showed my space. It was very spacious and private. Love the private entrance and the ability to come and go without worrying about disturbing the owners. The only problem and disappointment was not TV.
589,-1,"We did not meet Kimberley but were met as arranged by a friend.  The apartment was in an ideal location and the interior as described. 
The apartment itself is not easy to locate within the building and we found it difficult to obtain precise details from Kimberly prior to our arrival. Although inside the premises is OK, we found the building entrance felt unsafe and the approach dirty and smelly - particularly the elevator at the weekend after the nightclub.
Unfortunately soundproofing within the apartment is poor and it was noisy each night - not just due to the nightclub (about which we had been warned) but also the trains, neighbours, street noise etc.  Additionally there is no covering to the glass blocks at the front (there are no true windows) and bright street lights outside. 
The kitchen and bathroom are modern and well appointed and the apartment feels spacious.  Fine if location is your main criterion. 
"
590,-1,"It took a little time to get used to the house where the first floor are small restaurant that sell food out and elevator in the house is dirty. But the apartment is still nice and clean, as shown in the pictures on airbnb. The bathroom was very good. It is not possible to open the windows in the apartment. I was there for four days over the weekend there was no disturbance of the club below but on Saturday night there was a loud noise to at 2 am. Very good location."
591,-1,"Kim was very easy to communicate with. The apartment is exactly as pictured.  We stayed for a week, and anything we needed fixed or extra of, she provided.  Except the elevator which broke before we arrived, but it was a holiday weekend and of course it would be hard to find someone!

The location is great, but it is a bummer that there are no real window.    It never truly gets dark in the room.  This is a great short term place to stay at outside of Friday and Saturday night which is of course mentioned in the apartment description."
592,-1,"Beschreibung der Unterkunft hat sehr gut gepasst. Die Lage ist mitten im Herzen von Bosten. 

#Umgebung
Alle wichtigen Orten sind fußläufig gut erreichbar und Möglichkeiten zum Einkaufen von Lebensmitteln und Drogerie (Roche Bros + CVS) und Shoppen gibt es diverse.

#Internet
Das WLAN ist leider etwas schwach auf der Brust. Ich schätze mal das es sich um eine 1000er Verbindung handelt. Egal in welchem Teil in der Wohnung ich mich aufgehalten habe, kam es gelegentlich zu aussetzern.  Reaktionszeit auf eine Suchanfrage bei (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) war dadurch schon auch mal im Bereich von 1-2 Minuten :(

Ich bin dann für wichtige Sachen oder zum surfen in einen der vielen Umgebenen Starbucks gegangen (Empfehlenswert in der Schoolstreet, da kann man sich gescheit hinsetzen)

#Ausstattung / Wohnung
Die Küche ist relativ groß, allerdings nur mit dem nötigsten ausgestattet. Wer groß Kochen will, sollte sich spezielles Küchenwerkzeug organisieren oder mitbringen. 

Bett ist eine einzelne Matraze - Kingsize - hier sollte man sich darauf einstellen, dass man jede Bewegung des Partners in der Nacht spürt. :)
Eine zweites Set an Kopfkissen/Decke waren ebenfalls im Schrank vorhanden. Bettwäsche war bezogen, hatten trotzdem eigene zur Vorsicht mit und diese auch genutzt.

Es sind KEINE Fenster vorhanden, somit kann man auch nicht direkt lüften. Einzige Lösung ist die sehr gut funktionierende Klimaanlage die im Winter wohl auch als Heizung dient. Ist zwar relativ laut, hatten damit aber keine Probleme. 

Apropo laut - wie in der Beschreibung steht finden Freitags und Samstags im Mojitos Partys statt (Musikrichtung Salsa/Latein). Die Musik läuft bis ca 2 Uhr Nachts und ist sehr gut zu hören und zu spüren. ;-)

#Sauberkeit
Die Wohnung war größtensteils sauber. 

#Service 
Wir wurden stellvertretend sehr nett von Rami empfangen, der sich auch Zeit genommen hat um uns alle Fragen zu beantworten und draußen in der Straße die wichtigsten Orte zu zeigen oder den Weg zu erklären. 

Außerdem wurden uns ebenfalls ein Bestand an Handtücher für die Zeit der Anwesenheit zur Verfügung gestellt.

#Fazit
Unsere Erwartungen wurden erfüllt und die Location ist sehr gut um eine zentral Ausgangslage in Bosten zu haben. 
Als Gesamtnote würde ich 90% bewerten, da dass leider nicht geht
1 Stern Abzug. 

Ich empfehle die Location auf jeden Fall weiter und würde selbst auch wieder kommen."
593,-1,"Location is unbeatable, just steps from the Common. The unit is bigger than a typical hotel room. There are some minor layout issues (no outlets or lamps near the bed) and we had intermittent wi-fi and there's no cable. 

It wasn't perfectly clean, though the housekeeper had mixed up which unit we were in, so that may have been why. 

Entrance is through a small indoor market that smelled a little of grease. But if you can live with that for a cheap place in a great location, it's a minor issue. "
594,-2,"Wohnung ist genauso, wie es auf den Bildern aussieht, sogar noch etwas grösser. Saubere und zweckmässige Einrichtung. Im Eingang des Gebäudes befinden sich noch mehrere Take-Away-Läden und es sieht alles etwas schäbig aus. Ist man dann allerdings in der Wohnung, vergisst man dies schnell. Wände sind sehr hellhörig. Die Lage ist grossartig, sehr zentral gelegen, hervorragend! WLAN ist so gut wie gar nicht vorhanden, die Logindaten für das Netzwerk sind zwar verfügbar, aber es konnte keine Verbindung hergestellt werden. Zeitweise kein warmes Wasser in der Wohnung. Kimberly lotste uns telefonisch zur Wohnung. Sie vermietet wohl noch andere Wohnungen und wirkte nicht wirklich gut organisiert. So erhielt ich nach der Abreise - ein eigentliches Check-Out gab es nicht - eine Reihe von SMS und Anrufen, dass wir doch hätten abreisen müssen und sie nun unser Gepäck wegwerfen werde. Es stellte sich dann heraus, dass sie wohl die Wohnung verwechselt hatte. Eine Entschuldigung, abgesehen von einem ""Sorry"" gab es nicht. FAZIT: Eine bessere Lage bekommt man für diesen Preis wohl nicht. Zum Übernachten ok, zum Verweilen eignet sich die Wohnung allerdings nicht."
595,-1,"The location is good but the apartment is in a derelict building and surrounded by derelict people. The smell on the ground floor is unbearable and I saw RATS scurrying around. We were continually accosted by homeless/drug-affected people. The apartment was not clean. The shower floor had ""person debris"" on it and is moldy. The kitchen bench was greasy and there is dust/grime in corners. The towel rack fell apart when touched. There are power points that are not fitted securely to walls."
596,-1,"perfect location, perfect size. it is a strange building, that being said i never felt unsafe.  "
597,-2,"Very questionable, smelly and sketchy entry to the commercial building including stairway to the 3rd floor (elevator not working). We (two females) were not expecting it to be that questionable and we felt on guard the whole time. If we were solo on this trip, this is not a place to stay as a single female. The inside of the apartment was as advertised , clean and really in the central to all downtown attractions. Rebecca was very helpful with questions/communications. Highly doubtful I would stay here again unless the entry has a complete makeover."
598,-1,"A convenient location for a short stay during a layover. It was just a couple blocks away from the station and we had no problem finding it at night. Laura was accommodating in letting us check in late. The space is small but worked for just one night. The smell of smoke was hard to ignore upon entering though, and my friend who was traveling with me was particularly sensitive, so I would only recommend for people ok with that. "
599,-10,"To be very honest, I hoped not to leave a negative review but the actions of the hosts have led me no choice but to do so. 

First of all- I originally booked a stay from 8/4-9/4 but the host did not want to change the stay so I had no choice but to settle for a 8/3-9/3 stay. 

The hosts were pretty nice so I didn't want to leave such a review. But the stay was very uncomfortable. 

The house is extremely dirty and the conditions of the room were horrible. Yes there was a bed and a table and a chair, but it looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the last decade. 

Dust was EVERYWHERE to the point where you smelt dust when you were sleeping. The carpet was dirty and the floor was unclean. I'm not sure why they bother asking for a $50 cleaning fee when it doesn't look like anyone cleans it. 

Aside from this, the bathroom is indescribable. Its a TINY bathroom that around 6 people share- more if you include guests who sometimes come really late at night and can get REALLY disruptive and LOUD

Also, I know it mentions ""free breakfast"" but don't expect anything. There will be no free breakfast or anything. No one is going to cook for you or provide the materials to cook such ""complimentary breakfast""

But that isn't even the issue. I'm already spending $1,500 to stay here I'm not going to complain about a $2 breakfast.

The most despicable aspect was when I asked them to change the move out date. 

If you're going to follow a ""flexible"" policy then follow it.
If you're going to promise one thing, follow it. Don't say one thing and do another. 

I asked the hosts before I requested an alteration if ""I could request an earlier move out date"" 

If they said ""no"", I would've accepted even if it meant losing around $250

HOWEVER, they said sure we will adjust the stay and refund you the nights you didn't stay. So I went ahead and adjusted- and no reply. I asked them again in person AGAIN, and they said ""We have to talk it over and adjust it, no problem""

So I waited, until its already 9/3. Its been OVER 10+ days and they have been COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. 

So I contacted airbnb and basically FORCED the hosts to reply in which they rejected my request. 

?? excuse me, if you were going to reject it why tell me you would refund my nights?

Now its almost 1 MONTH after and they are still not responsive. I have called airbnb and filed an official complaint against them- including opening a case for them to return my money.

Whether my money is returned or not, I just want to warn everyone that:

1.) not a healthy, or clean environment to stay in
2.) don't stay here if you don't want to deal with irresponsible, frustrating people




"
600,-1,"- place was clean
- appeared to be new (not many personal things)
- never met Polina
- bed was a bit soft and air conditioner was a bit loud (I'm fussy)
- a bit of confusion on arrival/checkout times"
601,-1,"The only redeeming quality of this place is the location. It's easily walkable to all major attractions in the city, and right across the street from Boston Commons and close to shopping in the financial district. That being said, we were extremely disappointed with the cleanliness and noise. The place clearly wasn't cleaned prior to us arriving, and although the host agreed to send in another person to clean, we couldn't see any difference after that had apparently happened. Hair and dust everywhere, the bathroom had not been cleaned, and the tub didn't drain. The place is also directly above a bar and a late night pizza joint, which made it nearly impossible to sleep because of bar fights and drunk people screaming all throughout the night and early morning. A theater is also across the street with lights on all night, and due to the thin curtains which didn't close all the way, the apartment was brightly lit even at night."
602,-2,"Negative experience since the condition of the apartment is not matching photos nor description:
dirty shits dirty pillows dirty kitchen, broken window broken airconditioning, wholes on the walls, trash inside the condo.
We have documented the situation by pictures and sent them to the host and to Airbnb.
We left the apt right away the same day and paied for both the apt and the hotel.
Asked for a full refund. "
603,-1,"I was unable to make my one night reservation due to an emergency with my traveling guest, and having come down with Strep the day of check-in. I communicated this with the person of contact prior to my check in time and was told I would probably receive a refund and that he would inform Ahmed. I later communicated this to Ahmed, who denied me any refund. I would have thought Ahmed would have appreciated me sparing a sick guest at his studio, and was hopeful he would have been more understanding, but he was not. "
604,-2,"very nice unit in Southend, Boston. Close to restaurants metro station. The only problem I found was the noise factor! Other residence within the building are just so noisy and the outside traffic just never stops."
605,-4,"There were 3 of us middle aged women who stayed at the Mayhew. First of all, we wished we were told that the condo was on the 3rd floor, no elevator and had very narrow-steep stairs. Dragging our luggage 3 floors up/down was painful. Secondly, upon arrival , there was no bath soap, just sheets and bedspreed on the 2 beds no blankets, with 58-62 degrees weather forecast for the week, and no sheets provided for the futon in the tiny room off the kitchen. So 2 of us had to share a bed for the week. We asked for  and received extra blantkets  and towels only. We did not get any bath soap so we had to find an open store in an unfamiliar neighborhood that sold soap on our first night.. Third, the lights in the kitchen and dining room were so dim we could barely see each other. It was corrected the night before  we left! Too late! Fourth, we were expected to leave the place clean, carry the garbage down to 3 floors, take off all sheets and make sure that the kitchen dishes are cleaned or in dishwasher already cleaned. If all of these were expected of the renters--why were we charged cleaning deposit? NO dishwasher soap was provided either until the day before we left. Fifth, on our last day, we woke up with heavy gas smell in the condo and the stove was not working.  Apparently, there was work scheduled for that day in the basement! The least they could have done is warn us so we could have left the condo early, have breakfast out and not have to deal with the nauseating gas smell."
606,-1,"Alicia et Kostas sont des hôtes formidables qui font tout pour mettre à l'aise. La maison est très accueillante et on s'y sent comme chez nous. 
Ils nous ont indiqué dès notre arrivée les meilleurs endroits à voir dans leur quartier. Leur maison est vraiment proche du centre ville (10 min de métro) et il est très facile de se garer en voiture gratuitement dans le quartier. 

Le matin, café et jus à disposition en plus des conversations avec Alicia qui est une personne très sympathique et très ouverte avec qui il est facile de discuter (même pour des non-anglophones).

il y a plusieurs choses à voir dans leur quartier, ainsi que plusieurs bons restaurants.

Je recommande vivement."
607,-4,"Sarah was accessible and relatively responsive by phone, although I and my friends did not meet her. However, she advertised several amenities on this listing that were either unavailable or severely compromised during much of our two-day stay. Sarah was unaware that her internet provider had suspended her account, requiring me to inform her that this was the case (she had not paid her bill). My friends and I, all university students, were without internet access (of the utmost importance for students needing to complete assignments, especially at the end of the week) for no fewer than three hours upon arrival. Our first morning there, we discovered that the stove was inoperable because no gas was being delivered to it. We attempted to operate the microwave in the house, but while using it, at 6:45 AM on a Saturday with no precipitation, the power cut out to nearly all of the lights and outlets in the apartment. After I called her again that morning to resolve this second major issue (in a twelve-hour span, no less), Sarah told me that this was likely due to the fact that she would be moving out of the apartment at the end of the month -- another thing that she failed to inform me of at the time of my booking or arrival. Finally, the heating in the apartment was nowhere near satisfactory. My friends and I had to sleep with our coats on because the apartment was so cold. In addition to these pressing problems, the TV also did not have a functional remote, and one of her air mattresses had a hole in it. Overall, while Sarah seems like a nice person in general from our phone interactions, there were some egregious instances of her misleading me and my friends into believing that certain things about the apartment were true, when they were not. Our experience at this apartment was extremely disappointing."
608,-1,"Notre séjour chez Rachael et David s'est très bien déroulé. La chambre était propre ainsi que la salle de bain et le restant du condo. Le lit confortable, le quartier était bien et à proximité du train de banlieue qui se rend directement à Boston. Notre hôte Davis était toujours joignable pour répondre à nos questions et nous faisait lui-même ses propres recommandations. Vous ne pouvez pas avoir de meilleur hôte que Davis. Merci pour tout."
609,-3,"I stayed in the unit for 4 days with my parents. Previously I used to live in the Boston area for more than 10 years and know well about pros and cons about many apts in Boston – generally old buildings, limited parking space, high price, etc. The reason I chose this unit, not a hotel, was that I needed  kitchen and a table area for tea or light snacks. 

Unfortunately, this unit is very disappointing. The problem of this airb&b was the maintenance. When I opened the door of the unit, the air smelt damp and unpleasant. I wanted to take a shower but saw “brown water” coming out from the faucet. And the towels provided by the owner were all dirty and damp. My parents used the bedroom and I used the sofa, but the linens were not clean, and the sofa exuded very unpleasant odor. 

I had a very tight schedule in Boston, so did not have time to find another hotel. Since I couldn’t have had good sleep there, it affected my meetings. I reported this issue to the owner later and got $10 compensation (his reply was surprisingly short -- “thank you for your feedback.”) 

I never expected a maid service or impeccable condition, but at least “cleanliness and hygiene” could not be negotiated. The price I paid was not low either; I paid $268/night. I think, for the price, I should have booked a hotel. 

"
610,-1,"The Dorset apartment was ok.  Clean, everything needed was there, etc.  Location was not the best in town, but again, wasn't bad.  All kind of services nearby.  Customer service was the best!!!!  Lack of tv's in bedrooms and the one is there, is in a room that is very uncomfortable to watch.  Train station is also very close and transportation was not a problem at all.  My only complain is the access to A/C - Heat.  Is locked in a box and no way to control the climate inside the apartment.  In an overall, great value for the price.  Would I recommend it????  mmmmmmmm"
611,-4,"Horrendous wins my prize for my worst ever Airbnb stay. The place was dark and dirty everywhere (I kept photos as I couldn't believe it), for example floor was swept but not washed so walking with bare feet made feet dirty and sticky. 
So many of positive listing points and just not valid:
*Lift – there is one but it doesn’t work we were only told a couple of days before arrival so too late to make alternative plans despite it being broken for weeks. The room is on the 5th floor so stairs are a nightmare, especially with luggage and in the heat.
*4 windows – yes there are 4 but they are all covered up with quilting and tatty cloths that have been stapled to the wall so you cannot see out. The bathroom window has a towel stapled over it.
*Claw foot bath exists but has been painted and all the paint is peeling off – you could not sit in it.
*Air conditioning – was needed and was working but so, so noisy you can’t sleep or watch TV. Also you can’t use any other electrics – like hairdryer - at the same time as blows the fuse.
Location next to park is nice for the day but we were warned by the university that the park is unsafe at night and for 2 of the 4 nights I stayed there were police and ambulances out front.

Kelly was responsive and easy to communicate with for check in but unfortunately a key was lost so we had to find the lock box in an alley behind the apartment block at night in the dark and we were very uncomfortable with this. 

Left a day early and would not recommend!

612,-1,"Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'ambiance de cette belle maison dans un quartier tranquille, mais tout près de restaurants et magasins, et à 10 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro directe pour le centre de Boston. La chambre était joliment agencée, et nous pouvions librement disposer de la cuisine (énorme !) où il y avait - en plus du petit déjeuner inclus dans le prix - des boissons et des fruits à volonté, ainsi que de bons petits gâteaux préparés par la fille de la propriétaire... Cette dernière est très accueillante et sympathique, et fait tout ce qu'elle peut pour vous rendre service. Si jamais nous retournons à Boston, c'est sûr que nous irons chez Robin !"
613,-1,"Nous avons apprécié chaque moment de notre séjour chez Robin. Victoria s'est montrée extrêmement accueillante et nous savions que nous pouvions compter sur elle en cas de besoin. Le quartier est calme et sécurisant. Quant au logement, il était propre et nous avions une salle de bains personnelle. La décoration est impressionnante et captivante... nous sommes d'ailleurs repartis avec plein d'idées en tête. Notre seul regret est de ne pas avoir eu le temps de faire plus amplement connaissance avec les autres visiteurs AIRBNB, Lyse et Jay (sorry guys!)Nous recommandons vivement ce logement et y retournerions sans hésiter! Thank you so much!!!"
614,-1,"Nous avons passé deux agréables nuits chez Robin et Victoria. Bien que nous n'ayons pas rencontré Robin, sa fille Victoria nous a très chaleureusement accueillis et s'est tenue disponible pour nous durant notre séjour. 

La maison est vraiment superbe, grande et accueillante. Le parquet craque mais ça fait partie du charme :)
Le lit est très confortable et la chambre est lumineuse. 
La salle de bain privée est propre et le fait qu'elle soit sur le palier ne nous a pas déranger. Par contre, la douche n'a pas beaucoup de pression.
Deux autres chambres sont louées dans la maison (une seule l'était lors de notre séjour et la cohabitation s'est très bien passée, aucun problème de bruit).
Petit + : petit-déjeuner à disposition dans la (magnifique) cuisine.

Pour rejoindre Park Station au centre-ville, il faut compter 45 minutes au total (15 minutes de marche + 30 minutes de train).
Le trajet est un peu long mais le quartier est sympathique et le train passe assez souvent.

A côté de la maison, il y a une rue bien animée où vous trouverez des restaurants, des bars et des magasins.  Nous avons beaucoup apprécié cela lors de notre arrivée tardive car ça n'a pas été un problème de trouver à manger à quelques minutes à pied.

Nous recommandons vivement cet hébergement et nous y retournerons avec plaisir à l'occasion. Merci Robin et Victoria."
615,-1,"Das Haus ist exakt so, wie es sich auf den Bildern darstellt und beschrieben ist. Es ist sehr sauber, hell und freundlich eingerichtet. Die Küche und der angrenzende Aufenthaltsraum sind großartig und die Einrichtung so, dass man sich prima selbst verpflegen kann bzw. wird auch ein kleines Frühstück bereit gestellt, das sich jeder unkompliziert morgens zusammen stellen kann. Es herrscht eine offene und willkommene Atmosphäre, die viel Raum lässt, sich auch zurück zu ziehen und den eigenen Aufenthalt nach belieben zu gestalten. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel. 
Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig und es gibt im unmittelbaren Umfeld, alles was man braucht inklusive ganz netter Restaurants, Bistros, Cafés, Yoga-Studios, Reinigung, Friseur usw. sowie den Jamaica Pond in unmittelbarer Nähe, um sich draußen aufzuhalten und zu relaxen. Es war ein ganz großartiger und komfortabler Aufenthalt - gerne wieder!!! :-)"
616,-1,"The room and the appartement were confortable and clean. The appartement is well situated, close by subway stations and with all you need around : food stores, bakerys, etc. It is also not so far from downtown and main sight-seeing places. 
Beware ! It was a bit difficult to find a place to park the car, mostly ""resident permit only"" places and not a lot ""visitors parking"". 
The only thing I would say is that one of the cat was a bit agressive, it scratched us a few times. "
617,-1,Susan was good host. She was very informative and quick to respond. The apartment is in an excellent location and very central to a lot of places in Boston. There was a pungent odor (possibly from previous animals) in the apartment and the bath tub was slow to drain.
618,-1,This was the worst place I have ever paid money to stay in . I should have known when the host said- There are clean sheets on the bed- DUH- The radiator behind the bed clanged all night- We did not sleep at all. The toilet and bathroom were disgusting. Please avoid this place.
619,-7,"Beware. It's hard to find a much cheaper place downtown Boston but there is a reason why. So many things that should be simple went wrong with this stay. 

The code provided to open to front door was wrong. 

The key wasn't on the rack where they said it would be. 

The room was not cleaned (dirty towels strewn on the floor, bed undone, dirty carpet). 

While the managing agency apologized and tried to fix the situation, it was too little too late. They also promised a discount to make up for their incompetence that I'm still waiting for. 

Even if your check in goes well, understand that this place is kind of a dump. Musty smell, dirty bathrooms and bedding. The walls are thin as paper and you *will* hear everyone else.

This place may still show 5 stars (they ask for it via post its inside the unit), but don't be fooled."

Any i did not recommend yo stay longer.
And when stand lamp was broken,but she did not prepare new one ,
She said lamp stand was design.
The room lamp was dark to read guide book.
I think she did not have the mind of

"
622,-1,Nous avons été déçu de l'ensemble de notre expérience des le commencement en ayant aucune réponse avant notre arrivée de notre hôte  ( ayant vu ses commentaires précédents on se demandait même si l'hôte allait annuler à dernière minute).Quand nous sommes arrivées dans le logement nous avons constaté l'insalubrité du lieu; chambre non accueillante ressemblant à dépôtoire  (affaires sous le lit dont mouchoirs usagés  et commode remplie). La salle de bain reflétant la chambre. Nous n'avons pas été accueili par katlin;le petit déjeuner ne ressemble pas du tout aux photos. Quartier non accueillant et à environ à 45min/1h du centre de Boston. Nous avons été également surprise de l'absence de wifi. 
623,-1,"Nous avons passé 3 nuits chez Kaitlin.
C'est une douce personne. Elle nous a agréablement accueillis bien qu'elle fût pressée. 
En revanche, la chambre était sale. Beaucoup de bazar sous le lit, pas d'armoire utilisable. Le ménage n'avait pas était fait dans la maison non plus y compris dans la salle de bain. Ce que Kaitlin nous a elle-même déclaré.
Une nuit, minuit passée, du bruit et de la musique nous ont empêchés de dormir. Nous avons dû demander à Kaitlin de baisser le son et de faire moins de bruit. La musique a été coupée, mais le remue-ménage a continué. Quand ce n'est pas Kaitlin et sa mère qui s'interpellent en pleine nuit, ce sont des gens qui crient depuis la porte d'entrée pour appeler Kailtin. 
Le petit déjeuner : rien à voir avec les photos alléchantes piquées sur internet. Elle nous a proposé plusieurs choix à notre arrivée (en l'occurrence fruit'n toast et Egg et Bacon). Mais nous n'avons eu que des pancakes aux sirops (très bons cela dit), et jus d'orange. Et le dernier jour, l'un de nous a pu avoir des œufs (sans le bacon) et du café. Bref : très déçus.
Juste un mot sur le quartier : des bus réguliers desservent le quartier vers les métros (à 1h du centre-ville). Le quartier est très mal entretenu malheureusement, et peut ne pas inspirer confiance, surtout la nuit. 

Kaitlin est agréable mais hélas elle n’est pas du tout prête à être hôtesse."
624,-7,"Kaitlin was very personable and communicated throughout the booking and was flexible with our unknown arrival time. She informed us that we could call on her any time during the night if we needed anything. However, we were VERY disappointed with the appearance of the room, its furnishings, its bare appearance and quality of bedding. There was one bare ceiling light bulb, nothing covering it, no bed lamps. We expected towels, washcloths, and pillows to be waiting in the room and not have to ask for them. There was air conditioning in the apartment, but nothing in the room. With the door closed it was uncomfortably hot. There two windows, one with damaged tangled, mini blinds. A large headboard (not attached the bed) blocked any air that did manage to make it through the window. The mattress was dirty, worn and lumpy. No mattress pad made it even less appealing. The sheets were thin and worn and did not seem to fit the bed. Street parking was available, but limited. Breakfast was acceptable. Hot coffee upon arising would have been welcome. Most of the pictures on the listing were of her breakfast; there was no photo of the room to which we were assigned. Coming from a small rural community we were uncomfortable with the neighborhood.
It was quiet, with the exception of a constant beeping of a dead smoke alarm battery.

626,-1,"Vorab, es gibt in diesem Gebäude 3 beinahe identische Wohnungen welche nach Verfügbarkeit vergeben werden. Die Bewertung bezieht sich nur auf Wohnung Nr.3!
Leider war unser Eindruck ziemlich negativ - trotz Angabe von 4 Gästen und doppeltem Nachfragen im Voraus, fanden wir nur Handtücher für 3 Personen vor. Das Ausklappsofa war so schmutzig und heruntergekommen, dass man von niemandem verlangen kann, daruf zu schlafen. Die aufblasbare Matratze, welche wir im Schrank fanden war leider auch nicht sauber - ebenso wie sie provisorischen Kissen und Laken (Flecken, Haare, Fussel). Wir haben uns Wolldecken gekauft, da dies wirklich unzumutbar war. 
Küche und Schlafzimmer so wie auch das Bad waren okay (Fußmatte jedoch auch fleckig und eher abstoßend). 
Positiv empfanden wir das Gebäude ansich, die Organisation vorab und auch die Lage ist wirklich prima ( 5 min. Fußweg zur Orange Line - Mass. Ave und in Laufnähe zum Fenway Park der Red Sox. 
Wohnung kann man max. für 2 Personen empfehlen!"
627,-1,"Pros:  The location is very convenient, just a couple of blocks away from the subway station and close to the airport.  Our bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast and coffee selection was satisfactory, and the price was hard to beat.  

Cons:  They have an excitable springer spaniel who apparently likes to sleep on the furniture.  The dog only made a few appearances while we were there but jumped on our bed at one point, and the whole house smelled of dog.  This is not necessarily a con if you like dogs (which we do), but people allergic to and/or afraid of dogs should be warned.  Also, the bathroom is old and the hot water on the shower faucet was really touchy."
628,-1,Pour notre première expérience avec airb&b nous sommes ravies d'avoir été chez Jim et Afiyah . La chambre étais propre tout comme les sanitaire et le lit confortable. Nous avions à notre disposition la cuisine pour les repas (petit déjeuner a disposition ) et également un salon avec vu sur l'eau. La maison est vraiment magnifique et agréable à deux pas du métro . Nous reviendrons sans hésiter chez eux !
629,-1,"The space was comfortable. Breakfast spread was generous. If you visit in late summer, be aware that there is no A/C. My concern going in was that noise might be a problem being SO close to the airport - it wasn't."
630,-2,"When  we arrived the house  was locked  and  we  had  difficulty with the  combo  provided by the hosts which  were not  there.  Another  guest  was inside and let us in.  He  said he had  been there  3 days and had not seen  anyone.  

We  must have  been  fortunate  because  after  being there  for  a  couple of hours and  finding out  we  had  to share  a bathroom with a deplorable looking tub and  bathroom that was littered with old  shampoo  bottles etc with 2  other guests   ,jim  stopped by.

This  was  fortunate because it gave me an opportunity to tell him  we would  be checking out  in the morning ,2 days early. His  reply was ""ok""  . I  had  expected to  get  some  money back in  accordance  with  their moderate  cancellation policy but have not heard any thing  from the hosts.

This  was very upsetting to us as I was in Boston  for medical  reasons and  a move was  very inconvenient."
631,-2,"I would definitely recommend this place given how close it is to the airport and its low price. Additionally, the impressionist paintings in my room were a nice touch. 

The owners sent me elaborate directions on how to get here. An Uber from the airport cost me a total of $16 (airport surcharge is $8.75), and my trip back to the airport at 7 in the morning was $19. One of the drivers at the airport said the airport taxi charges around $35 for the same trip. You can also take the metro or bus if you don't have much luggage and want to spend less on travel.

The only problem I had was with the bathroom door, which is hard to open and has no lock. You need to knock to make sure no one's using the restroom before walking in. The bathtub also looked a little dirty. However, considering price and distance, this is not a dealbreaker and I would be down to staying here again. 



"
632,-7,"On June 4, 2016 we stayed at the Airbnb for Jim and Afiyah, in Boston, Massachusetts.  The house was close to the airport and it was on a relatively quiet city street.  The windows were sound proved so the noise from the airport traffic was not noticed.  Afiyah greeted us and showed us our room. Our accommodation was a single bedroom, adequate in size and we shared a bathroom which was a drawback for us. Because of the many occupants in the house, we were not sure who shared the bathroom another drawback for us.  There were no locks on our bedroom door or on the bathroom door, in fact the make shift bathroom door was a bifold closet type which made it difficult to feel safe  when in use.  The house itself appeared to have escaped maintenance for some time and seemed too much for them to handle, as evidenced by the ill kept back yard.  The broken closer on the front door, stuck out 12"" across the threshold causing a dangerous situation.  The biggest concern of all was the dirty bathroom tub.  The filthy tub hadn't been cleaned for a substantial amount of time as noted by the bathtub ring.
I would be reluctant to return."
633,-1,"she let us use her kitchen, coffe and refrigerate, and a very ""expensive""  kitchen. collection, "
634,-1,"Hilary est toujours prête à donner des renseignements, conseiller des endroits dans la ville... La maison est très agréable, certes un peu petite mais tout à fait confortable. Expérience locale assurée! Le quartier est vraiment très tranquille, très familial. La maison est plutôt facile d'accès en métro mais il faut compter environ 20 minutes pour rejoindre le centre de Boston en voiture. "
635,-6,"Hermina has broken her terms of agreement by asking me to move room during the last day of my stay. Even though I had been really busy during the whole time, and didn't have time to pack and move rooms, she has forced me to do so, just because someone else has paid more money to book the entire upper floors of the house. This has caused me much inconvenience and a lot of anguish. I was forced to move into the basement, without access to filtered drinking water, and have to give up access to the kitchen (apparently the new party moving in booked the kitchen too, and I was not allowed to go in there). I had to remove all my food from the kitchen and finish them before the last day. I have requested that she properly compensate  me by refunding me 1 day's fees, but she has refused. She has offered to compensate me for a small amount, which I feel is insufficient for the anguish she has caused. I have obliged and moved room because the housekeeper, Donna, has been really nice, and I didn't want to cause trouble for her. By reneging on her promise to provide the agreed service to me after accepting my payment, I feel that Herima is dishonest and does not care about her guests, rather, she is just after the money, and will betray you for just that. People, be warned. the same thing may happen to you. Don't stay here."
636,-2,"Kate was a fantastic host.  Our stay was pleasant and what you'd expect for the price.  Kate does have two very sweet cats, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I'm mildly allergic, but I didn't have any problems.  I did notice a bit of a ""cat smell"" at first, however I seemed to be the only one.  None of my friends had any issues.

The only real downside is that the place is a bit out of the way (a 12-15 minute walk from the T).  Frankly, I'd recommend renting a car if you'll be traveling around the city, particularly at night.  Boston cabs are fairly expensive ($40-50 from Cambridge, $15-20 from the North End, $45 from the airport), so you'll end up spending roughly the same amount on a cheap car rental.

"
637,-4,"Kate has two cats. One of them was very unfriendly: she scratched my daughter. Kate's house was very busy: a lot of personal stuff: Fridge was full with expired/rotten food, bedding was very old and dirty overall. Her response was very slow. When I asked about super hot temperature in her house, all she cares about was her cats( I have a 1 year old baby, it was very uncomfortable for him to stay in that temperature all the time).  For me, no A/C in the house is not a big deal as long as temperature is manageable. However the kitchen was like an oven. She has very very small fan in the Kitchen which didn't help with cooling down the temperature at all. She didn't not keep her words about the price she could offer me, she even complain that I negotiated. 

 I have been traveling around and renting houses quite often. She is the worst ever. As a host, I cannot believe how unfriendly she is."
638,-1,"Nous étions 5 et nous sommes restés 3 nuits chez Kate. Tout s'est très bien passé, la maison est grande et agréable, l'accès en transport en commun au centre ville est sans difficulté, le stationnement des véhicules ne pose pas de difficulté. La communication par mail et téléphone avec Kate a été parfaite."
639,-1,"Kate est une hôte exceptionnelle. Malgré son absence, elle a répondu à toutes nos questions et donné de très bons conseils pour notre séjour. 

Ses deux chats sont agréables et de vraies patapoufs. 

Sa maison est décorée avec énormément de goût et très agréable à vivre en famille. La cuisine et les salles de bains sont très propres et totalement équipées. Les chambres sont spacieuses et les lits de bonne tenue. 

Le quartier de Roxbury est difficile à définir. Quartier Black, avec voitures de luxe et certaines maisons délabrées. Quartier vivant avec match de basket le soir mais aussi courses de motos sur Martin Luther King bvd. Nous avions une voiture ce qui facilitait beaucoup de déplacement vers le centre (15 min). 

Encore merci à Kate pour ce séjour. Nous espérons vivement  la rencontrer lors de notre prochain séjour à Boston. "
640,-1,"La maison de kate était parfaite pour notre famille (trois enfants de 11, 9 et 7 ans). Elle est spacieuse, conforme à la description et aux photographies publiées sur le site. Elle est très confortable et équipée de tout ce qu'il faut pour voyager en famille (notamment dans la cuisine). il y a la clim dans les chambre ce qui est vraiment appréciable l'été.
L'acceuil de Kate est très agréable et nous avons cohabité quelques jours en toute tranquillité.
Le quartier est sympathique même si il est un peu bruyant les soirs de match de basket mais c'est tout à fit supportable et cela s'arrête tôt.

646,-1,"we stayed one week in the cottage. We saw Bill once, After 4 days! Linda we never met. they were on a weekendtrip. So we can not say that they were giving tips or were friendly. We could not say goodbye to them, there was no one at home. Not even give the key back by person.
The cottage is very small if you're tall. The bed was to short and to small for my husband and me. We are both tall 1.94 mtr and 1.78 mtr. and normal bodysize. North European lenght.
So the ""cosy"" kitchencorner was also too small for our legs . 
There was NO Wlan (as advertised) in the cottage,  if I needed information from the internet I had to sit outside on the stairs of their house! I needed internet for online checkin for our flight back , it took me more than one hour because the internet turned off several times. 
We thought is was very noisy, The fan in the bathroom is very loud and the waterheater also. 3 big , 1 small towel for 2people in 8 days is also to little. 
We would defenitely NOT go back."
647,-1,"J'ai passé 16 jours merveilleux dans ""ma petite cabane"" sur la colline surplombant la baie de Boston. Le logement est propre et simple, mais dispose de tout l'équipement nécessaire. Bill est un hôte très accueillant, qui se met en quatre pour répondre à vos besoins. Il a grandement contribué à rendre mon séjour plus qu'agréable."
648,-1,"Wir haben zwei wunderbare Tage in diesem renovierten Haus verbracht. Alles mit Parkett. Wirklich toll. Ein Haus zum Wohlfühlen, sauber und mit sehr viel Platz. Ein Garten war auch dabei.  Als ein Rollo zu Bruch ging,  wollte Juliet keine Erstattung. ""Things happens !"". Das fanden wir sehr nett.  
 Wir würden jederzeit noch mal bei Juliet wohnen und können es nur empfehlen. Die Umgebung in dem Vorort von Boston war sehr ruhig und man ist schnell in Boston Zentrum. Die Nachbarn haben immer nett gegrüßt. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind ca. 500 m entfernt. Wir würden jederzeit noch mal bei Juliet wohnen und können es uneingeschränkt empfehlen. Nochmal herzlichen Dank an Juliet für die schöne Zeit in Roslindale !"
649,-1,Superbe maison dans un joli quartier. La maison est très confortable avec de très grandes chambres et beaucoup d'espace dans les pièces communes. Tout est là pour y passer du bons temps en famille ou entres amis.
650,-1,"Das Bett war frisch bezogen und es gab einen Korb mit frischen Handtüchern. Die Räume sind wirklich grosszügig. Nicht erschrecken, die Strasse vorne ist busy, aber das Schlafzimmer geht zu einem wirklich ruhigen Hinterhof. Die Anbindung an Busse ist gut.Die Busse selber sind ein wenig unberechenbar. Das Viertel bietet eine Menge nette Lokale und Geschäfte und die Architektur ist Klasse. Es lohnt sich, viel zu Fuss zu machen. "
651,-1,"The apartment is swanky. Everyone was impressed when they first walked in. It has an interesting layout with lofted bedrooms overlooking the living room. The living room has nice high ceilings, the only ones in the apartment. In the bedrooms, no one over 5' 10"" can stand straight. It's not unusual for the layout, but it is annoying and I did forget and hit my head more than once.

So you'll want to spend most of your time in the living room, and if the pullout sofa is being used you would need to put it away during the day. We were in town for a conference and spent few waking hours in the apartment, so that didn't matter. There is a giant flat-screen television which we never turned on; it contributes to an overall bachelor pad feel of the place, but not offensively so.

Outside the apartment is less nice. The neighbors were noisy and the lobby is surprisingly shabby. Beacon St. itself is practically a highway, with cars racing down wide lanes and button operated pedestrian signals that make sure a hundred autos can zoom by before you are able to cross. Also there's one of those unfortunate ""Cheers"" themed bars on Beacon. The good thing is, you are less than 10 minutes from Charles St. (It would be 5 minutes with more humane signaling: petition your unfriendly Boston DOT.)"
652,-1,"I cannot recommend this place. The two bedrooms have half height ceilings which means you have to bend your head in order to get in. It's crazy. I've never stayed anywhere like it. It'll make a great pad for hobbits but normal sized people beware. ""Architecturally unique"" indeed! Seamless have simply cut in half a regular property and created a most ill-suited conversion as a result. Frankly, I'm furious that Seamless didn't mention this on the property description. It's evidently a critical fact which they dishonestly omit. 
The location is good, but that's the only redeeming feature because you can't wait to leave this cramped apartment.  If they had described this place accurately there's absolutely no way we would have booked it. I suspect the same would be true from some of their other guests. 
"
653,-1,Awesome studio with an even more awesome location! Walkable to basically everything in the city. A little noisy at times but nothing crazy. Would definitely stay agin!
654,-5,"   The neighbourhood is two metro stations away from down-town and in walking distance from the airport, which is very convenient. The neighbourhood was quite different from the other ones we visited in Boston and we did not feel as safe. 
   Richard was not in town, but he was always reachable via phone and email, which was nice. We were welcomed by a friend of Richard. He told us that there was no hot water in the apartment and that he is expecting the plumber to arrive in 10 minutes. He tried to leave us with the plumber and skip, but we insisted he stay. Everything was fixed in one hour. Richard apologized many times for the inconvenience, but the hot water was only till next morning when we woke up and we had only cold water till the end of our stay there (2 days).
   The hot water I understand, things break, you cannot anticipate that. We did not research the neighbourhood, it’s our fault, can’t complain about that. One thing that really pissed me off is that there was cleaning fee included in the price, but unfortunately the apartment was very dirty - dirty dishes, dirty towels in the bathroom, dust all over the place, lots of stains on the sofa and chairs, bread crumbs everywhere!  
"
655,-1,"I booked this place for my parents because they had an early flight and wanted to stay near the airport. The place is extremely old and run down. The floor boards creak, and the window in the bedroom cannot be closed all the way. I did not stay over night, but my parents said it's extremely creepy at night - the wind blows and the window makes noises. I would not book nor recommend this place, (at least not for older folk). If you just need a place to crash before a flight, the location is pretty decent. "
656,-4,"Buyer beware - poor service, no actual stay, unclean, no refund. We had an unfortunate and very short stay at Richard's apartment. When we arrived at the apartment, if smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and air freshener. We had to leave after 10 minutes and book a hotel.

When we contacted Richard, he refused to cancel the room and refund our payment. He told us he checked with the previous guest and his cleaning person who both insisted there was no smoking - too bad we didn't take a picture of the cigarette butts on the balcony. His comment in his email: ""You can go ahead and give me a bad review...This is a business for me"" 

 We regularly use airbnb and have always had good to great experiences, this was our worst. We love that the comment and rating system works to weed out bad actors from the system; we're hoping this review helps in that process.

Das Appartment liegt in einem gediegenen Appartmentbuilding in perfekter Lage am Boston Common in Beacon Hill. Man ist quasi Gast im Boston State Haus. Die U-Bahn-Station ""Park Street"" ist 250 Meter entfernt. Im Haus nebenan ist ein kleiner Supermarkt. In direkter Umgebung sind mehrere Restaurants, Bars, Kaffees und weitere Supermärkte. 

Zum Fenuil Markt sind es z.B. gut 10 Minuten zu Fuss, zum New England Aqarium keine 20 Minuten.  Zu Macy's dauert es gut 5 Minuten, zum Beginn der Newburry Street - einmal durch den Park und damit etwa gute 10 Minuten. das Prudential Center oder die Public Library dürften keine 20 Minuten entfernt sein. 

Das Appartment besteht im wesentlichen aus einem Raum, dazu Abstellkammer und Bad. Es hat wertigen Parkettboden. Überhaupt ist das gesamte Gebäude in gutem, wertigem Zustand und verfügt über einen Portier/ Sicherheitsdienst. Im Appartment ist ALLES (selbst Bügeleisen/-brett, Wasserkocher, Kaffeemaschine, Toaster, 4-fach Herd, Ofen, Mirko, kräftiger Kühlschrank, Besteck, Geschirr, Spülaschine, TV, DVD Player, klasse Internet per W-LAN usw.), was man an Nützlichkeiten und Annehmlichkeiten braucht, vorhanden, direkt auf dem Flur gibt es Waschmaschine und Trockner. Dazu kommen Details wie ein BRITA Tischwasserfilter. Das Bad ist sehr komfortabel und genügend groß. Es hat ein eigenes Fenster. Der ABSOLUTE KNÜLLER ist die Dachterrasse mit PERFEKTEM Blick über Boston.

Das Appartment ist für 1 Person oder 1 Pärchen geeignet, wenn es auch nicht viel kleiner sein dürfte.

Par ailleurs, elle a regroupé une grande quantité d'informations utiles (connexion internet, commerces proches, adresses de restaurants / bar dans les coin, possibilités de transport) dans une gros classeur, ainsi que quelques guides touristiques sur Boston et sa région. Elle nous aussi prêté sa voiture pour une escapade sur les côtes alentours.

Sa maison est très cosy. La cuisine est très bien équipée (sauf lave-vaisselle) et il y est agréable de cuisiner. Les chambres sont grandes et chaleureuses, à l'image du reste de la maison. Les lits étaient fait et Fiona nous a fourni serviettes de bain et torchons.
Seul bémol : il faut compter 30 à 40 minutes pour arriver à downtown crossing avec bus+orange line. Un peu long.

The building has a great location to numerous subway lines, food and entertainment. Was also an easy walk to old North End. Friday & Saturday nights proved to be very loud with the street clogged with cars, loud music and ambulance sirens till 3:00am. The apartment is getting a little shabby with chipped appliances, scuffed walls, and dingy carpets. The smell of pot is heavy in the hall as soon as you get off the elevator, and can sometimes be smelled from the apartment. Checking out was easy with just a text to Eddie and a pleasant response back from him.   "
667,-3,"I stayed for 7 weeks. The apartment was really dirty when we got in, the floors were darkened with dirt and full of hairs. And there was a rotten pumpkin in the living room... The mattress smelled really bad the first night and in the morning we realized it was pissed on... Thankfully Ahmed replaced it in 4 days, until then we slept on the couch, which was comfortable. WARNING: It is impossible to sleep without earplugs on Friday and Saturday, and there is a homeless shelter across the street, so be prepared for people pissing on the front door and dealing drugs. Ahmed's associate Eddie was always helpful and responsive. The location is central and convenient but I would not stay there again."
668,-8,"My entire experience involving Alex was very unpleasant. From reserving the Apt to writing this review. When I first contacted Alex to make a reservation he told me he didn't know if he could make the apartment available for myself on the days I requested. Mind you he had these dates set to available on his Air BnB calendar. He accepted the reservation last minute and told me check in was at 3pm. When I arrived in Boston Alex told me over the phone that I could not checkin until 8pm because he hadn't prepared the apartment for my arrival. Already I'm beginning to see how dis organized he is. Once I arrive at the apartment everything looks great until I enter the bathroom. The bathroom toilet was beyond filth, the shower obviously hadn't been cleaned. there was hair in the tub and used razors laying out. The bedroom looked cleaned but on further inspection (once I looked under the bed and in the closet) it became clear it was just a result of lazy disorganized cleaning. There where dirty clothes and used condoms under the bed and all sorts of miscellaneous items alike where shoved in the closet. The bed was hard as rock. Literally it was all metal springs, it was so uncomfortable I had no choice but to sleep on his couch. The kitchen also looked clean but in true Alex's disorganized style once I opened the fridgorator all I saw was spoiled food and God knows what else. When I contacted Alex to explain my concerns and asked him to help rectify the situation he met me with very rude remarks and basically told me that my request where invalid. Alex is truly a terrible host. He should not even be allowed to use Air BnB. Learn from this review and save yourself time and money. "
669,-4,"Sorry to say, Izzy's standards for providing accommodations are very low.  I was greeted upon my arrival by a broken screen door. I couldn't access the lock box arrival because the porch light was out. Fortunately, a fellow occupant, let me in. She complained, rightly, that the place was dirty. She had spent hours cleaning it. There were two mousetraps in the kitchen. The bathroom light worked intermittently. No bars of soap were provided. Spoiled food was in the refrigerator. No fire extinguisher or sprinklers were in evidence. There were no fire escapes. The dense, uncut brush in the front yard is a breeding ground for rats. The front steps leading to a low iron gate are so steep that if one slipped one could be impaled on the gate. Need I go on? Stay here at your peril."

671,-1,"Il est vraiment facile de trouver l'adresse depuis l'aéroport en suivant les indications d'Izzy et c'est appréciable d'arriver si vite. Quand le vent est favorable, on n'entend pas les avions, seulement les oiseaux qui chantent le matin. La chambre est fonctionnelle, propre, avec seulement une petite fenêtre (air conditionné pour qui veut).  Pour y aller, un escalier bien raide comme dans toutes les maisons du coin. La salle de bain est très propre, très sollicitée le matin quand la maison est pleine. Izzy est attentif à ses hôtes, discret et de bonne compagnie. 
Pour un séjour simple favorisant les échanges avec d'autres voyageurs, une adresse amicale."
672,-1,"didn't see Izzy during our stay. room as described. getting there a bit less obvious from the train. close to airport. other airbnb""s in the house so could be a bit cramped if all full."
673,-1,Very lovely and hospitable. The only downside was that the second step from the top step is crazy creaky and the bathroom is downstairs. If you make a lot of trips to the bathroom at night (like me) then you might risk disturbing other guests.  
674,-1,"Jim was very welcoming.
My flight got delayed but he was very accommodating to the time change. He also gave me some advises on places to grab a bite."
675,-1,"The apartment has indeed been updated, but it's in a basement of a very sketchy building, with nearly no natural light. It worked for me, as I just needed a bed for a work-related trip, but for a vacation this would have been quite dreadful. Watch out for the various fees (e.g., late check-in) buried in the listing."
676,-1,"Everything was as described in the listing, apartment was clean and welcoming. The only issue was the lack of hot water in both showers the day we checked out."
677,-1,"The apartment was light filled and very clean!  I was disappointed there was no printer available (Mikhail indicated that it had recently broken and he had not had a chance to replace it yet).  Other than that everything was as stated in the listing.  The apartment was located close to the B Branch of the Greenline train. I suggest when going into Boston, you go to the Warren Street Station and when you return you get off at the Washington Street Station (that way you're going downhill both times!)"
678,-1,"This was our first airbnb experience and to be honest: it was ambiguous.
First i have to say that there is a lot of space, you have your private floor and they provide shampoo and soup so you don´t have to take care of those things (which is very kind and convenient).
BUT there were a few strange things: you have to go through a very cluttered and dirty room to get to the private room. I don´t understand why they leave this place so cruddy...moreover the fridge in our room was full of mold. "

La chambre est très bien et correspond à la description. L'accès à la salle de bain et à la cuisine sont très faciles. Nous recommandons fortement de contacter Carl car c'est réellement une des meilleures place où loger sur boston!!"
681,-1,"Let me start by saying that Sean kept us up to date over the course of a few hours while he straightened out a situation with the keys he has to various properties. I can give credit where it's due. We arrived after dark and had no problem finding the place or the lock box where the keys are kept.
My problem lies within the actually apartment itself. The bed is listed as a 'real bed' but is in fact a futon frame with a standard mattress being used as the box spring and a futon mattress on top of that. This is an older apartment building and I realized that walking in but full strides weren't taken to clean the place. The chair and comforter both have significant stains on them. 
We don't ask for the world from our Airbnb hosts. We don't need shiny new things and brand new high rises but this place wasn't well tended for in the least. 
We called Airbnb in the morning, told them our concerns and immediately left. We were originally booked for 4 nights and had we arrived in the daylight never would have stayed for the first."
682,-4,"Host have very clear instructions about how to get to the place and how to get the key via a lockbox (a bit sketchy but nothing to bad).  The apartment is located in a great area; it's about five minutes from the Kenmore t stop which is right near Fenway. However once getting into the apartment we were a bit disappointed. While we expected a smal place we were not expecting the room to be boiling hot and between the heat and the noise (from Fenway area, complex itself wa very quiet) it was impossible to sleep in. With no thermostat to change heat and what appeared to be a futon to sleep on despite ""real bed"" being listed we ended up leaving the apartment at midnight. Overall the price was cheap but I guess you get what you pay for. Would not stay in again."
683,-2,Que dire de Tiffany???? Les mots manquent!!!! Nous n'aurions eu qu'à penser avoir besoin de quelque chose pour l'avoir! Mais tout était là! Très aux petits soins. Un logement aussi beau et agréable que sur les photos. Un quartier résidentiel calme proche des commerces et métro. Très très bien.
684,-1,"There was plenty of contact from tiffany both before and during our stay. We felt tiffany would have sorted out any problems if we had any. 
House description was spot on. 
Neighbourhood was residential and had short walks to local amenities. "
685,-1,Our experience staying at Tiffany's place wonderful.  I would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Boston as the location was also a plus.  The only thing that was challenging was finding parking as regulations are very stringent.  
686,-1,Space is basically a Hallway with three bedrooms and an oversized Kitchen.  It is not made clear how many people are behind the other 2 of the 3 bedrooms.   If you don't mind not knowing who else is behind the other doors then it shouldn't bother you.  3 people sharing one bathroom can be problematic
687,-1,"A third taxi driver from the airport agreed to take me when the previous two did not recognize the address. I should have been told the apartment is in Chinatown or given a reference point such as 'Tufts medical centre' which is nearby. 
The place was clean with new and modern but cheap furniture. Did not feel like a home at all. 
Had two major issues with the alarm going off for hours and one night the entry lock did not work so could not get into the apartment for 15 mins till finally the contact person called another tenant to open the door. The contact person who is not Sue or Stanley arrived an hour later. She did not apologize or reassure me but told me ""if you are so unhappy you can check out early"". An extremely scary and unpleasant experience.

Il est spacieux propre et le propriétaire est très réactif en cas de problème. Bien qu' en plein centre ville il n'est pas bruyant, sauf pour la climatisation. Un bon choix très rentable dès qu'on est plus de 4. A noter un supermarché alimentaire très bien fourni en fruits et légumes juste à côté."
690,-5,"The apartment was nice.  I felt harassed by the host as he sent multiple emails, texts, and a voicemail during our 2 night stay.  We were also accused of inflicting significant damage to the concrete floor and of breaking the toilet seat in half.  While it is probable that one of our guests cracked the toilet hinge, we neither damaged the floor nor ""broke the seat in half."" The host needs to learn to temper his hyperbole and contact his guests only one-two times during their stay."
691,-1,"L'appartement est tres bien placé, il dispose de 2 chambres confortables et d'un espace de vie tres large.
Le fenetre tres large presente un atout pour la luminosité mais il faudrait accentuer son isolation thermique et phonique, ainsi l'appartement gagnerait en confort.
"
692,-2,"Nice place in a convenient location but lots of partying going on in the neighboring apartments, and the common area was filthy. It was really loud at night as people were screaming and running through the hallways. Not sure if this is an ongoing issue or if we were there at the wrong time. "
693,-1,"
Sarah est une hôtesse parfaite : charmante, prévenante, tout avait été prévu pour notre arrivée. Elle est très facilement joignable s'il y a la moindre question.  La description de l'appartement est fidèle à la réalité. L'appartement est bien placé, dans un quartier calme. Il est très bien tenu et charmant. Nous avons tout fait à pieds dans Boston en étant situé dans ce quartier. "
694,-1,"Firstly, thank Ming to make an exception for a student to rent. To be honest, I had a terrible experience there. Ming is not a bad host but kind of stint. The room is stuffy and rough. Ming sometimes turns off the Wifi in the midnight. Ming turns off the power as soon as I am no in the room, even though I was taking a shower in the bathroom."
695,-1,"La photo correspond tout à fait à la réalité et la chambre se trouve pas loin du centre de Boston en métro. Nous avons vraiment apprécié ce séjour et nous remercions Anthony et sa femme pour leur accueil chaleureux.
Julien"
696,-1,I was visiting Boston and on the night I was supposed to be at Anthony's I had an emergency back home and had to fly back home immediately. I let Anthony know via text immediately as soon as I found out and Anthony was very understanding. Since it was such a last minute cancellation I let Anthony know I would be okay if he went ahead and charged me for the night. Anthony was very responsive throughout the experience whenever I had any questions. It's unfortunate that I couldn't meet him in person. 
697,-1,"The room was clean and it looks like the photos, but the bathroom was really dirty and the people who live in the apartment so noise. There was a bad smell from kitchen"
698,-1,"We stayed with very nice people, the house is near a Subway station , but rather noisy ( next to the Subway rail road and the high way)."
699,-1,"Appartamento molto comodo e vicino alla fermata della metropolitana, stanza discretamente grande e all'apparenza pulita, stessa cosa non si può dire del bagno che essendo in comune andrebbe pulito molto più spesso."
700,-2,"I was a little nervous about the area at first but everything went okay with our stay. I would suggest the owner invest in some WD-40 for his door hinges, however. They are quite loud. "
701,-1,"The woman who is the permanent resident/renter was there to welcome us. She was friendly and showed us around. This is a very plain apt. - no frills - and the neighborhood is somewhat seedy, but not dangerous. Many homes have peeling paint, trash in back yards, things in disrepair, weeds growing in sidewalk. "
702,-1,"Sarah is a wonderful host and such a wonderful person!  She was very accommodating and kind.  The room was clean and private, spartan, yet functional.  There is no AC, but even though it was in the 90s while I was there, I was not uncomfortable and the place stayed cool.  The neighborhood struck me as being on the rough side, but I had no problems while I was there.  There is a substantial police presence, and it is well-lit at night."
703,-4,"The host did not ask what time I would be arriving, so I assumed they would be home all day; they were not. When I arrived they sent me text message instructions how to find the key, and when I walked in, the place was a mess: old food on the table, beer bottles on the counter, an unpleasant smell, and the couch not prepared for sleeping. The host did hurry home after this to clean up and prepare the bed and apologized that his roommate was supposed to have taken care of this. Had no problems after that, except a noisy upstairs neighbor."
704,-1,"Wir, 2 Erwachsenen und 2 Teenagers, haben uns sowohl in der Wohnung wie auch im Quartier sehr Wohl gefühlt. Die Beschreibung und Ausstattung entspricht voll den Angaben und Bilder. Obwohl wir der Vermieter nie persönlich begegnet haben, hat alles geklappt: von der Übernahme der Wohnung bis zur Lösung eines technischen Problem in der Wohnung während unserem Aufenthalt.  Wir haben auch geschätzt, die zur Verfügung stehende Waschmaschine und Tumbler vor unserer Weiterreise verwenden zu können."
705,-1,"When we arrived on Saturday neither Nina nor Mike was there.  We had to use a lock box to get the keys.  Nina asked us to say we were friends visiting if any neighbors asked.  It made me feel uncomfortable because we didn't even know their last names and she was asking us to be untruthful.
We were able to park on the street very close to the apartment, but had to be sure to leave on Monday before 8am because the street sweeper was coming and the car would be towed if it was still there.
It was a walk to get to restaurants, but there were lots to choose from and there was a Whole Foods to buy any food or snacks.
We went to Fenway Park for a Yankees/Red Sox game.  We took a taxi to get there and it only cost $12 plus tip.
We were told there would be bagels in the freezer for breakfast, we could not find any.  There was a french press coffee pot to be used to make morning coffee, but no instructions.  Not everyone is familiar with them.  We had to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it to find out.
The dish washer was full of dirty dishes and the dish drainer was overflowing with clean ones so I left dirty coffee cups in the sink even though we were asked to clean up after ourselves.  I did run the dishwasher but did not attempt to put anything away.
The bottom of the bath tub was not skid resistant.  When I took my shower, I slipped, but did not fall.  When Dean showered he slipped and fell pulling the shower rod down and landing on the floor.  Fortunately he did not injure himself, but he has 2 knee replacements and he was lucky.  That tub is dangerous.
Names of restaurants they recommended were left for us, but no addresses.  We had to look them up on our computer.  What would someone do if they did not come prepared?  Not everyone has a smart phone.
We never met Nina. Both Nina and Mike returned later on Sunday, but Nina was not feeling well so was in her bedroom when we got there after going to Fenway Park and dinner.  Our only knowledge of her was in e-mails.  We did talk with Mike.   "
706,-1,"The room is very near the airport - but it was quite hard to find- fortunately somebody helped me.  Sadly when I got there I was unable
to open the key box to open the door to the place and never made it in. It was late at night and while I called and texted the host, I received no response.  I had to leave and find a hotel.   I obviously can't judge the place itself but would suggest that people have a firm arrangement to be let in by the host.  

"
707,-8,"Don't risk your time and money.  Here is my unbiased review:

This was a misleading experience with bad room condition, worse condition than $20 hostels I've stayed at abroad.  The room location changed twice, and upon arrival at the second confirmed room location, the key we found under the mat (as instructed) did not fit in the door.  Upon calling Hermina (the host), she said that the person might still be occupying the room that was reserved for us (she wasn't sure), and said she had another room for us.  It was not a room, it was a dusty, low-ceiling attic with poor lighting and an air mattress.  The sheets smelled of urine odor.  There were old sneakers propping up a small window.  This neglected space had random stored items scattered in it, clearly not a place to put paying guests.

We were confused and disappointed, but didn't complain, being it was late and we were tired and none of the rooms we were promised were available.  We reluctantly slept on the uncomfortable air mattress in the attic, and booked out of there asap in the morning.  I wish there had been an alternative.  For $70, this is nowhere close to the condition I would have expected.  Though it's conflicting that there have been good reviews for this host and location, it's possible no one else has had to sleep in the creepy attic.  So, just letting you know - don't let that happen to you.

I have used AirBnB before, and my past experience was by far- much better than this one.  I really enjoy giving great reviews, and am disheartened to have to report this as a bad one."
708,-1,"Overall, we had an average experience. Donna, the woman who takes care of the house was more than helpful the entire time. Somehow, there was a mix up with bookings and we were unable to check in to our room because someone had decided to stay an extra night. Donna quickly got us into another room and even moved our luggage to the room we were supposed to be in the next day. The only other problem we had was a little mouse who ate a bit of some bread that we had in a shopping bag in our room. Donna told us that she was already handling that problem and it should be fixed soon."
709,-1,"Fue muy sencillo encontrar la casa con las indicaciones de Herminia, está muy cerca del metro y llegar al centro de la ciudad es rápido. Donna, lo mejor de la estancia!  es muy amable y nos resolvió todas las dudas. La habitación es igual que en las imágenes, amplia y limpia. El único problema es que se escuchan bastante los ruidos de los demás inquilinos de la casa.
Se puede usar la cocina y por la mañana Donna nos invitó a desayunar con café, fruta fresca y pan. Muy recomendable para quedarse en Boston! "
710,-1,"INsgesamt sehr schöne Unterkunft und ein geräumiges Zimmer, dass nicht nur mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet ist. Die Küche kann man tatsächlich sinnvoll nutzen, falls man das möchte, da Dinge wie Öl oder Gewürze, die man nicht unbedingt für einmal Kochen kaufen möchte, vorhanden sind. Wärmstens weiterzuempfehlen."
711,-3,"Hermina was a very accommodating, kind host. However there is no A/C in the room and during our stay we made the mistake of leaving the windows open. It was extremely noisy, but after closing the windows the noise was less of an issue. I also did not feel safe walking home from the T at night."
712,-1,"La communication avec Sarah via airBnb c'est effectué sans encombre. Nous avons également pu la croiser peu après notre arrivé.

Les lieux correspondent bien aux photos présentés sur le site. 
Il y'a également un lave vaisselle (appréciable), ainsi qu'un PC dispo sur place.

Cependant la propreté reste à désiré : cuisine un peu crasseuse, poêle collante, cheveux qui traine sous les lits, dans la douche, dans les coins. Baignoire crasseuse, ect...
Manque également un peu de matériel pour cuisiner : poêle, fouet, récipient, et un grille pain."
713,-1,"The location was great, it's just a short walk away from the Boston Commons and a few blocks away from Chinatown.  The unit itself, however, is a different story.  Photos are a little deceptive, we felt as we were staying in a cheap motel.  Parking was also a disappointment as we were required to pay $30 a night when it was a parking spot on their private lot!  For the amount of money we paid for the room (200+ a night), we would have expected parking to be included.  Nonetheless, Eddie was great (although we did have a pillowcase missing) and the location was convenient. "
714,-1,"Convenient location but paper thin ceiling and windows. One can hear conversation from pedestrian walking by, noise in hall way, and almost every movement up above you. Very difficult to sleep if you are a light sleeper. Boston is an old city so some of this will be expected but guests should be aware of these conditions."
715,-1,"Tout était parfait ! Nous sommes aller du 21 au 23 juillet 2015. Appartement très propre ! Ned étais disponible pour répondre à nos questions. En plain centre-ville, idéal pour tout faire à pied. Je le recommande."
716,-1,"Ned nous a rapidement montré le studio qui est très agréable et très bien équipé. On sent que tout est neuf et propre. Le classeur laissé à l'intention des invités répond à toutes les questions et fournit plein de conseils (Whole Foods, restaurants, etc). Le studio est vraiment idéalement placé pour tout visiter à pied ou en métro (ligne rouge). La vue depuis la terrasse du toit est fantastique. Le service de concierge ans le hall de l'immeuble est aussi très pratique (je recommande le très sympathique Michel qui parle très bien français car il est Haïtien !). A recommander sans hésiter."
717,-2,"From Jan 29 to February 21. There is a pub just 70 ft far away, and it is noisy during weekends. No laundry within building, need 15 to 20 minutes walk for washing cloths. Normal day will be fine, but it will be challenging after storms. TV only have several local channels, and unfortunately I missed the super bowl and all star games this year."
718,-3,"The condition is very simple. The room does not have air condition, but the outside air conditioner machine of other rooms made a big noise, together with the noise of the fan of our own room, made us difficult to fall asleep. No towel prepared. No TV, no table, and the living room is small. The rest room is shard.  "
719,-1,"I was thoroughly unimpressed by ""Will"" who is actually Boston Short Term Rentals (BSTR). I understand that companies use airbnb and often this is fine - what you lose in character is often made up for in convenience and cleanliness. However this was not the case here. 
Firstly, we were not staying in the room in the picture - ours was much smaller and though it had the same furniture, we had a view of a brick wall so there was never any sunshine, and the drawers were so close to the bed as to be inaccessible. 
There was no cutlery in the ""kitchen"" apart from one bent steak knife, no glasses and no pots or pans to cook with. There were tiles coming up on the floor of the shower, and our towels stank of bleach - as if they had not been rinsed properly. Though at least they had been cleaned! 
When I phoned BSTR the next morning to complain I couldn't get through the first 3 times. When I finally did, I received no apologies and no offers to move to another apartment, but was told there was nothing they could do about the floor, but that towels and cutlery would be brought round immediately. I am now back in the UK 3 days later without seeing any of the items requested, or being contacted by anyone.
In short this is the worst airbnb experience I have had, and if i had booked directly with the company, I would have demanded my money back."
720,-1,"The room was not the actual room I booked, though it was in the same building.  It was far smaller, and so cramped it was impossible to open the door more than halfway, as it hit the nightstand.  The owner has the entire building and runs it like a hotel.  He did give me a discount for giving me the wrong room, but it still was very uncomfortable and claustrophobic. 

I also got a call waking me up early from the owner because another guest thought they were supposed to be in my room. Again, this company really needs to get a grip on their booking practices.  

However, it was clean, and it is a great location.  Very bare bones and small. 

"
721,-1,"The entire building is run by a short term rental company in Boston. The company was quick to respond when I reached out with questions about bag storage. We were drawn to the location, right in the middle of the South End with quick access to the Mass Ave T Stop on the Orange Line.  The room itself was very basic and fairly small but based on the price, this was to be expected. No major issues with the room although the TV stand was completely unattached to the TV, which wobbled all over the place and some of the knobs/handles in the unit with loose. My only frustration with the space was the extremely thin walls. It felt almost as if the people staying next door/upstairs were in the same room as us because you could pretty much hear everything. For the price and location, I am overall pleased with the visit, just wish the walls were a bit thicker. "
722,-1,"De mauvaises surprises malgré une communication très bonne au départ. L'appartement correspond à la description et est propre, mais il est bien difficile d'y trouver sa place : beaucoup d'objets personnels ""innondent"" le logement, chaussures au coin du lit, pas de place pour poser ses affaires... on ne se sent pas bienvenue, on a plutôt l'impression de venir chez quelqu'un qui n'a pas fait de place pour vous. Le chauffage tombait continuellement en panne, il n'a marché qu'un jour sur deux et il faisait très froid. J'ai décidé de quitter l'appartement en commençant à tomber malade tellement cela devenait invivable. Allegra a proposé de me rembourser les 2 jours non utilisés, ce qu'elle n'a pas fait, plus aucune nouvelle malgré mes relances et pas de remboursement. Vraiment dommage et décevant."
723,-4,"To be honest, The room was musty and dusty. we called it the Cave. 
Lost of things where broken, like the tiles in the bathroom. And a bit dirty. Dark room with no fresh air. 

However, the location is good And the room was really cheap compared to other options."
724,-1,"The location is perfect. The apartment is a bit of a weird set up, and because the three bedrooms are essentially different parts of the same room separated by just shutters, you can hear everything from each room and it doesn't feel very private. I'd say this is fine for a family, but a bit awkward for three colleagues, and would certainly recommend against this place if any of the rooms have couples in them - everyone else will hear everything. 

The flat was also very cold in the winter with no obvious way to turn the heating on, and we were provided with the wrong door entry code when we arrived which caused one of my colleagues to wait outside the flat for half an hour trying to get through to people and have the code reset. 

All in all, it was an ok stay in a great location, but watch out for the lack of privacy between rooms. "
725,-1,"Merci à Jessica pour son accueil. Nous sommes arrivés aux heures de travail et tout était organisé pour nous faciliter l'accès à notre chambre. Nous avons adoré le style décoratif de la maison, en plein cœur d'un quartier résidentiel. Calme, vue dégagée, espace confortable, tout était réunis pour nous reposer après notre passage à New YORK. Merci à Jessica pour ces conseils avisés sur les resto, visites et commodités et notre discussion en ""fran-glais"" en soirée. C'était une parenthèse bienvenue dans notre voyage américain."
726,-3,"While my stay at the Cozy Corner of Boston was very disappointing, Deborah was pleasant, cooperative and receptive to feedback.  Firstly, the studio apartment is in a very rundown and depressing block, mainly inhabited by students.  The photos give no indication of the worn and dilapidated condition of the furniture and the furnishings in the studio apartment.  

With no overhead lighting in the bed/sitting area, the place is dark.  There is very little room in the tiny bathroom to place toiletries.  Although the advertisement for this accommodation indicates that it has an eat-in kitchen, that would only be challenging without either standing up or removing a piece of furniture.  Most disturbing of all for me was the dirt and grime that met me upon my arrival.  For instance, the bathtub had some residue in it, a significant coat of dust clung to the furniture and every door handle and drawer handle was coated in grime.  

When I contacted Airbnb, they dealt with my complaints professionally and sensitivity. I appreciated that Deborah subsequently organized for the place to professionally cleaned.  I was also very grateful that Deborah allowed me a very late check-out time.

727,-4,"Stayed here for 2 months from January - March 2016. This is a nice house in the heart of hyde park. It is close to the high street shops, restaurants and grocery stores. It is also close to transportation. We rented a car during our stay and the driveway was very convenient for our use. The two bedrooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are nice. The kitchen is very well equipped. 

We encountered some issues with the house and the host. Barbara was not the greatest host and she was hot and cold depending on the day. She has a very brash tongue and is extremely rude. We gave barbara notice to check out of the house earlier than reserved. We followed airbnb policy online and gave sufficient notice, She refused to follow airbnb policies and issue us a refund. She ignored the request sent online and so Airbnb had to take care of that issue themselves. 
We had issues with rodents in the flat. An exterminator was sent out twice to address the issue. Barbara claimed she has never had rodent issues even though we met a rat trap in the house upon arrival. The rodent issue persisted even after the exterminator came to check the house out. 
We also has issues with the temperature of the house. It was winter and the house was unbearably cold. Barbara has instructions to leave the heat at 68 degrees which is absolutely unbearable even with the space heaters that were provided. It was constantly freezing in the house and we had to wear sweaters and socks and multiple layers all the time. The heat does not work. Especially in the master bedroom bathroom. Absolutely freezing! 

THE NEIGHBORS.... extremely loud neighbors. We pretty much had a concert going on every friday and saturday. The neighbors would run through the house all day long. We tried speaking to them twice and they basically slammed their door on us and told us to speak to the landlord. Barbara tried to speak with them on multiple occasions with no luck. This was a huge stress on us as we had a newborn and we needed to take naps during the day while he slept. The noise also sometimes startled him. 

Barbara tried to rip us off. She insisted we check out at 11am when she had no intention of refunding us for unused nights even when we gave her notice as per airbnb regulations. I had to file a complaint to airbnb resolution center. She was a terrible host. She was upset we didn't use her cleaner even though we cleaned the apartment regularly and kept it clean. Also upset that I rearranged the house. Who leaves their stuff in every single cupboard in the house. I simple put all her things in one place in the bathroom. Where was I supposed to put my own things? Ridiculous. Worst airbnb experience ever.

728,-2,"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour chez Georgia qui est tout à fait charmante! Elle nous attendait à l'arrivée malgré notre petit retard. Elle nous a fait visiter le logement, qui est tout à fait conforme à la description; très confortable, très propre et pratique. Oeufs, jus, rien ne manquait dans la cuisine même une assiette de muffins qu'elle avait prévu pour nous. Georgia a pris le temps de tout nous expliquer sur la maison, sur les excursions à faire sur les moyens de se rendre en ville,...
Un point de plus très positif pour ce logement situé dans une belle banlieue à 10 minutes  du centre de Boston en train rapide. La gare se trouve à 4 minutes à pied de la maison ainsi que commerces et restaurants. Bref séjour parfait mais trop court. Merci Georgia!"

There was a welcome basket of toiletries and kitchen supplies.  The doormen and the employees in the building were very helpful.  The layout of the apartment was fine and there was plenty of space.  But the apartment furnishings are run down and the upkeep of the whole building left something to be desired.  The photo does not reflect the living area, as the furniture is much different.  Almost every piece of furniture had a broken handle or major scuff, and there were stains, burned parts of carpet, and caked on dirt on most surfaces.  There were dried up contact lenses on the bathroom counter.  We could smell the smoke from the residents next door.  The blinds didn't fully close and let a lot of light in.  The casement windows didn't close properly and there was a lot of street noise when they were opened.  We requested another 2 lamps because one was broken and there are no overhead lights in any of the living areas, so things were very dark.  When the company brought 2 new lamps, one was broken.  We never got the TV in the bedroom to work.  "
731,-1,"Unbelievable! I lived there for one night. They gave me some used shampoo and conditioner samples. Conditioners even mixed with water. After I left 2 days, they sent me a requirement for asking fee for that( including late check out fee). They asked me the check out time, I only said around 10am. I left at 10:30, then they asked me for the late check out fee. "
732,-1,"Très bonne communication avec Daniel. L'appartement est dans une zone sécurisé, proche de l'eau avec tout le nécessaire pour passer un bon séjour. "
733,-1,Alan's representative stayed in close contact with us on arrival because we were unable to get to Boston until very late at night.  He was also able to obtain parking for our car at a reduced fee.  He accompanied us to the apt and showed us around.
734,-3,"The burner was more than dirty, revolting with rests of food, grease, etc. In general, the apartment is not clean.

WIFI connects only at certain points in the apartment and the coverage never reaches more than two lines in the icon of the laptop.

The appartment is allegedly furnished but it has just a bed, a coach, three chairs and a couple of tables. No furniture in the kitchen.
You can hear the echo there.

Kitchen empty: one mug, one spoon, one bowl and two dishes. Upon request I got coffespoon, fork, knife, saucepan and pan.
Not a single small appliance (microwave, coffe maker, toaster, etc.) only a refrigerator not really clean.

No towels. I got one upon request.

735,-1,"I rented this room for a cousin who was meeting up with us for a couple of days while we stayed there for almost 2 weeks. This room actually had a huge closet so if you need to hang your clothes, this would be the room I would pick."
736,-1,L'appartement est situé dans le chinatown au centre ville. C'est très vivant comme coin mais ce qui est vraiment bien c'est d'être à distance de marche d'à peu près tout ce qui est intéressant à voir à Boston! Jing a pris le temps de nous conseiller et nous a aidé pour le stationnement de la voiture. Il est vraiment sympathique! En plus l''immense lit était très confo! Très bon moments à Boston!
737,-5,"This has been without doubt the worst place we have EVER stayed at. The building to start with is ugly. The flat is even worse. It's uncomfortable, there is no decent air conditioning upstairs: it was so hot that our children did not get any sleep at all during our stay. We had to make them sleep on the couch in the living room... There are wires laying everywhere. The place was not clean: the handrail in the stairway is sticky , there were crumbs next to the beds, etc.
This has been a nightmarish experience for us.
There is no other word to describe this place.

738,-1,"Très bonne expérience, très bel appartement bien équipé. Rebecca nous avait préparé un petit panier de bienvenue. Le quartier est vraiment calme et agréable, plein de restaurants, de pâtisseries, bars et autres endroits sympathiques. L'appartement est proche de tout, les visites sont facilement faisables à partir du quartier, le métro est proche. À refaire sans hésiter !"
739,-6,"Hosts where away for week-end, on our arrival. Little bit of communication problem on both parts. They had sent us an email explaining where to find key. (But not a message via AirbandB where I was looking. 

The email ended up in my Junk file with a squllion others.) So we didn't know how to get in. Tried ringing several times, only to get an answering machine, left several messages with no reply. Finally posed message on AirbandB, and got a quick reply from RahSheik. All sorted then, shit happens. But we where getting concerned, it was getting late dark and cold, and we had been travelling for 2 days."
740,-4,"I would NOT RECOMMEND staying at this accommodation. This apartment is a one bedroom apartment that the owner has made into accommodating two persons by putting up a bamboo screen in the lounge room to create a false second room which she stays in. Naturally there is no sound privacy and it is ridiculously cosy. The second bedroom which I stayed in has an open window to a study which has an open walkway into the (URL HIDDEN) there is no sound privacy in the bedroom either. This means you hear phone calls, and well...pretty much everything. The worst part of my experience staying here was that I was duped for $658. I needed to leave earlier than I had booked for. The owner agreed that I could leave early and verbally said they would cancel the airbnb reservation. Two days after I left, I was charged a further payment for the remainder of my original reservation as the owner had not cancelled my booking. When I asked what was going on she evidently had changed her mind and decided that she would keep the money ... going back on our agreement. This really screwed my travel plans. I was shocked that she would do this and in speaking to AirBnB numerous times, there was nothing that could be done other to request the money back, which she refused. I thought I would be blatantly honest about my whole experience so that no-one need go through the same ordeal. There are plenty of nice, honest and trustworthy people out there, but this owner is not one of them. Take my advice and look elsewhere for accommodation in Boston."
741,-4,"All I can say is that it was ok.  I received rude texts from the host who gave me an hour-long window in which I could check-in (not their stated policy) and which I couldn't make because I was working.  Then they were late and ""on their way"" for about 20 minutes.  

The apartment was in poor shape in a low-rent neighborhood.  And don't forget to bring your own towel.  This guy is basically operating an overpriced hostel out of a crappy building.  "
742,-2,"This was our first time using Airbnb so we were not setting any unrealistic expectations. However we also were not expecting to be completely mistreated by the host. The apartment was perfect nothing to complain about there and the location was central and perfect close to day and night life, but the owner was very rude to us after we left the apartment. First she was late to let us in. We waited for about 10 minutes in the front door. She seemed very welcoming once we were inside giving us the run down of the neighborhood. On our last day we had to leave to go to the airport. Check out was at 11 so it was perfect. However at 11 the host said she would be there in 30 minutes. Since we needed to catch a flight she told us to put the key somewhere. As we were ready to leave is when she started giving us things to do. Strip the bed and put all the sheets in the hamper, in addition to the towels. In a hurry we did all that she asked and left. One hour later at the airport is when we started being bombarded with text messages. She was complaining that we did not leave the Charlie pass, that we did not properly strip the bed, that the garbage was left, and that food was left in the kitchen sink. She had the audacity to charge us $75 for all these ""extra things she would have to do"". I am beyond disappointed with how she treated us. The Charlie card only had $2.60 on it, which is equivalent to only one subway ride, the trash shoot was not mentioned, all the dishes were cleaned and put away, and everything was kept intact. Her apartment was treated perfectly and she did not appreciate that from us. Instead she tried every way to rob us of our money and we do not recommend this host to anyone. If she were on time to check out she could have told us any outstanding chores to do and we would have done them gladly, but she did not make that possible."
743,-1,"The place was very good from the pictures, but not good for staying few days. Not much of consideration for guests, shower towels only, dark lighting, noisy constructions around, no parking space. "

745,-1,"Schönes und gut gelegenes Apartment, insgesamt hat es uns dort sehr gut gefallen. Der Gatgeber Richard ist sehr hilfsbereit und organisiert das Ganze sehr professionell. Die Dachterasse ist super, von dort aus lässt sich übrigens wunderbar das Feuerwerk am Unabhängigkeitstag beobachten. Zu dritt kann es wegen des Ausziehsofas zwar ab und zu etwas eng werden aber wer bereit ist, es tagsüber immer wieder zusammen zu schieben, sollte mehr als genug Platz haben. Ein kleines Manko ist die angrenzende größere Straße, aufgrund derer es vorallem morgens etwas laut werden kann. Es gibt außerdem leider keine Möglichkeit, am Abreisetag die Koffer zu verstauen, falls man erst später am Tag abfliegt. Auch wenn Richard gerne gute Tips gibt, wie man dieses Problem lösen kann, wäre es doch super, wenn hier eine einfachere Lösung angeboten würde."
746,-4,"Terrible experience. 
I woke up at 2am and what I found was pretty scary:
- A syringe in the kitchen sink 
- Lots of pubic hair in the bathroom sink
- A kitchen which was completely messy (pasta plates, stuff on the floor)
- 4 guys & girls sleeping on the other bedroom, with the door wide opened and the light switched on (guess why)

Earlier, in the evening, my girlfriend and I thought the experience was not good:
- Many spots on our bed sheets that we had to put ourselves
- Towels were new but not washed
- Friend's of Josefa's brother smoking weed at 9pm, and had a small party in the other bedroom (at least it was not that noisy: somehow, they realized they had AirBnB hosts)"
747,-1,"Jay war bereits im Vorraus sehr engagiert und teilte schriftlich alle nötigen Informationen mit und beantwortete alle Fragen schnell und ausführlich. 
So ist es gar kein Problem, dass man ihn während des Aufenthalts nicht persönlich sieht, da er trotzdem jederzeit als Ansprechpartner zur Verfügung steht. Er war stets sehr freundlich und zuverlässig!
Die Wohnung war neu renoviert, sehr schön, hervorragend ausgestattet und in einem wirklich ansprechenden Viertel von Boston.
Wir würden diese Wohnung jedem weiterempfehlen."
748,-2,"House was very clean, new and functional. Not very central but very close to the bus station where you can catch bus to downtown. 15 minutes away by walk to the train station. But the core issue for us was the street passing by the house; source of a noise which is hard to stand when you are sleeping. We are easy and deep sleepers but  even we were not able to sleep. After the second night we needed to carry the whole matress infront of the kitchen and closed the door between kitchen and the bedroom. It was the only way to sleep. A medical center is close to the house and ambulances makes everthing worse."
749,-1,The apartment was exactly as pictured.  Some of the furnishing were a bit uncomfortable but it met our needs.

La proximité avec les lignes orange et verte est très appréciable et permet de rejoindre le centre ville rapidement. Le quartier est relativement calme et les commerces à proximité sont pratiques. Alexandra est une hôte très discrète qui ne cherche pas à engager la conversation. Elle a su toutefois répondre à toutes nos demandes. "
753,-3,"We stayed at Alexandra´s place for two nights, four people (two couples) and we rented out the two rooms. Issues as stated by other guests include: Subway smell, cleanliness of the bathroom and rooms, air conditionning always on (made a very loud noise in the room with the two  air beds) and locked with password.  We completely agree with Chases's review. "

755,-1,Book the room you will have no regrets! Very close to the airport.
756,-1,Experience was ok got a room to sleep at night but as AC was not there so it was very uncomfortable
757,-1,"Als wir an der Unterkunft eintrafen, war der Gasteber nicht anwesend, die Türen zur Wohnung standen jedoch offen. Unser gebuchtes Zimmer war belegt, sodass wir ein anderes Zimmer bezogen haben. Tom machte bei unserer Ankunft einen verwirrten Eindruck und meinte, er habe mit unserer Ankunft erst um 23.00 Uhr gerechnet. Unsere Ankunft um 16.00 Uhr war jedoch zuvor von ihm schriftlich bestätigt worden.

Das Badezimmer war in einem äußerst unsauberen Zustand (Haare, Zahnpastareste). Wir haben Tom gebeten, diesen Zustand zu beheben. Er sagte dies zu und merkte an, dass er sich dies gar nicht erklären könne, da er drei Mal täglich das Bad putzen würde. Das Bad wurde nach allem nicht noch einmal gereinigt. In der Küche haben wir eine Maus gesichtet.

In der Unterkunft werden drei Zimmer über Airbnb vermietet. Zwei Zimmer von Tom, ein Zimmer von einer ""Monica"", die sich hier als Mitbewohnerin ausgibt, dort aber offensichtlich nicht wohnt.

Insgesamt raten wir von dieser Unterkunft - trotz der günstigen Lage zum Flughafen - ab. Airbnb hat uns die Hälfte der Miete zurückerstattet."
758,-1,Tom nous a bien accueilli. Nous avions beaucoup de retard. Le logement est proche de l'aéroport et à 2 stations de métro du centre de Boston. 
759,-1,"La chambre est très confortable et propre. La salle de bain est propre et la cuisine bien équipée pour confectionner et prendre les repas. L'appartement est situé dans un quartier très calme et à environ 20 minutes à pied de l'aéroport. Demander le chemin à Tom tout de même. Tom est une personne très accuillante et très intéressante. La, maison à vraiment une âme."
760,-1,"Tom's place was roughly a 7 minute walk from the T stop Maverick and only one more stop from the airport. The neighborhood seemed kind of sketchy and we didn't feel 100% safe. Once we entered the apartment we went up the 3 flights of narrow stairs and opened the door to a thick cloud of stench. Smoke or something. If you are sensitive like we were, you will be coughing. The bedroom was decent and had no smell once we were in there, but there was a dirty towel hanging on the chair and it made us question what else might not be clean. Only a single body pillow on the bed to use as a pillow. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel room.

If you're in for a quick stop and aren't very picky then you should be fine here. "
761,-3,"This is my first experience with Airbnb and I must say that I am disappointed.  I booked Tom's place reading his positive reviews but the experience that I had at his place was not pleasant. 

We arrived at 9 PM at his place. He was not there instead he gave us directions to access keys to his apartment by phone. The key was hidden in a lock box. Following his instructions,  we made several attempts to open the box but failed to open . He then got pissed off and told us to cancel our reservation and find some other place since he could not personally come to handover the keys.  We were there at 9 PM with two big suitcases and two carry-on items and we were totally unfamiliar with the Boston area and unprepared for this kind of response. Where would we go at that time of the day? After trying for several times, we somehow managed to open the box and got the keys. When we entered into his apartment a cat jumped on us. We didn't expect this and informed him over the phone that there is a cat in his place. He told us that it is not his cat and he doesn't know how the cat got inside. At that point, we were scared if something was wrong in the apartment and we asked him if the place was safe to enter. As soon as I asked this question he just freaked out and hung up on us and didn't answer his phone afterwards. Scaringly we entered inside and luckily nothing was wrong. We expected him at least to assure that nothing was wrong but got a very rude response.  

Moreover, the room that we got was not good.  We paid $93 per night but the pillow was so saggy that I used the towels in the room as my pillow. The mattress was also saggy. The table lamp was not working.  Overall, we had a bad experience at Tom's place though he seemed to be apologetic when we met him the next day and helped us to bring down our stuff downstairs."
762,-6,"The very small room was incorrectly advertised as a studio. The as advertised futon was old and worn and the sheets appeared unclean.The room security was a flimsy hollow inside door in view of the other 'hostel' rooms opening onto a cramped common area. 
The stairs to the second floor space were extremely dark without a light. The back door entry way to the street was open at all times."
763,-1,Ricardo was quite responsive whenever he was reached out to. The common toilet (there is one functional) and another soon to be functional for 4 apartments. This is very inconvenient. There is also some renovations going on and the place smells of paint. It is a soft bed and hence very troublesome for people who have back problem
764,-5,"Worst experience. Stay away. It's a dump. The floor is tilted so steep you roll out of the cheap futon if you don't hang on. The shared bathroom only had one half of a shower slide pane so the entire bathroom was soaked when anyone showered. Because each room of this dilapidated building was used to rent out, the tiny bath rarely had any hot water for longer than a minute. Rooms were not cleaned each day. Hostel International would never endorse this place. Code violations were everywhere you looked. Charged over $100/night - hotel level pricing for that neighborhood. Total rip off. Never again."
765,-1,"Ricardo fait en sorte que vous soyez autonome dès l'arrivée, clé sur la porte, arrivée quand vous voulez. Chambre petite pour 2, canapé-lit peu confort mais pour 2 nuits ça passe! Cuisine nickel et quartier calme proche de Logan et downtown! Bien placé! Bon sejour"
766,-1,The room was small. But not bad.
767,-1,"Le séjour chez Ray a été tout à fait agréable! C'est un hôte très sympathique, attentionné et discret à la fois (notre café était même prêt lorsque nous nous levions). Le métro est à 5 minutes de marche et ça prend environ 20 minutes se rendre au centre-ville. Nous avons beaucoup aimé le quartier, en particulier le fameux City feed and supply pour son café et ses sandwichs-déjeuners et le restaurant Vee Vee pour une bonne table le soir. Merci pour l'accueil, Ray!  

Isabelle et Sylvie"
768,-4,"The place was not what we expected. One of the air mattress was damaged. Page sent a replacement the next day, but it was still one REALY uncomfortable  and spoiled night. There was a  bad smell in the kitchen which we had to avoid going into at all time. Need to keep the door closed to avoid spreading the smell all around the apartment.

"
769,-1,"Great neighborhood, we were a short walk from wherever we really wanted to go or from a public transport stop. Our group was on the larger side and we had no problems fitting everyone. There are a couple of car parks near by which can be a bit pricey but you won't really need to drive anywhere else. I think I can speak for my group when I say we'd all stay there again"
770,-3,"Paige was a great contact for the listing. She quickly responded to each question (of which I had many as I had never used Airbnb before). We did not have many problems with the exception of the TV which only pulled in one channel. That was disappointing. It was not fixed during our stay, but perhaps you can ask about the situation before you rent this listing. Even though the picture shows the room with the exact bed we had etc., the feel of the room is different than you see in the picture. The room feels older and darker, and has plaster pealing off in the bathroom. There are no curtains, even though there are curtain rods in this room. One window over the blow up mattress does not have any window dressing at all. Plan on dressing in the bathroom or putting on a show for those on the main street.The furniture is minimal and the blow up mattress for the last two people, has to be blown up and made up by the renters. FYI the listing did not say there are a tremendous number of steps you need to climb to get to the unit from the street level. Not appropriate for older or handicapped people."
771,-1,Superbe chambre. Nous n'y avons passé qu'une nuit mais aurions pu y rester bien plus. Elle est très spacieuse avec une salle de bain privée. Tout est fait pour qu'on s'y sente bien. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Dan mais il a été très disponible par message. Son accueil à été parfait. Le quartier est très tranquille avec des transports très proches pour rejoindre le centre-ville.  Je le recommande donc !!
772,-1,"The room is clean, but unfortunately, when we arrived, the bathrooms were dirty and remained so for the two days we were there. Not is the Airbnb that standard we are accustomed."
773,-1,"Hi Jay--everything connected with pre-arrival was great; good communication, timely responses.
Arrival at the ""luxury"" apartment was disappointing. Ikea style furniture, uncomfortable dining chairs with cheap poly covers. The master bed room: no chair, no bedside table, a failing light, just a few hangers and a bed so soft one could not sit on it and put on shoes. Worn towels.  The kitchen didn't even have salt and pepper---it really felt like a motel. 
The long walk up 4 flights is no problem, but the halls stink of diesel fuel.
Although the neighborhood was great, the apartment is situated on one of Boston's noisiest corners.  Impossible to open the windows.  I think calling this a luxury destination is a total misnomer."
774,-1,"L'appartement de babak est conforme aux photos. Très bel endroit où l'on se sent bien. Parfaitement bien placé pour les transports en commun (tram) qui permettent de rejoindre le centre ville en 10-15 min. Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer Babak mais celui-ci a été plus que prévenant pour nous indiquer les bons restaurants et bars de son quartier. Très disponible tout au long de notre séjour, Babak à plus que facilité notre arrivée. 
Merci Babak ! "
775,-3,"The North End neighborhood is great. This place is located on the first floor of an old building at the end of a narrow court. It's practical to deal with our luggages but means also that the natural light is rather poor and gloomy. And also, walls and floor are really thin : we share the neighbors' life. The kitchen-bathroom are okay but what happened to the nice furniture that we saw on the picture ?! Eaten by the ugly plastic coated couch and the old bed and mattress ? If you consider the roaring noise of the AC system under the front windows and the lack of cleanliness in parts of the place (man, take a look at the layers of dust on the fan, the brick walls, below and around the bed) we were very disappointed. We hope the price we paid for cleaning will benefit the next guests. "
776,-2,"Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'endroit; le studio en soi, sa localisation dans la ville. Tout était à proximité. Nous avons découverts de beaux endroits, des cachets du quartier. Nous sommes arrivés juste après la tempête du siècle et c'était magnifique. Jose était disponible, nous avons eu la chance de le rencontrer. Nous a recommandé des endroits où manger. Le studio en soi était à la hauteur de nos attentes. Rien à dire. Je réserverais à nouveau sans hésitation. Merci."
777,-1,"Tout était parfait, l'arrivée s'est déroulée comme prévue et l'appartement était génial! Très bon suivi de l'hôte en cas de problème.

780,-1,Terrible room. It's a futon bed with no sheets.
781,-3,"The apartment was beautiful and spacious. There was a smoke alarm going off the last day but it didn't wake me up at all at night, which I was worried about. Sarah did mention when she gave us the tour that the bed was very loud and that was really the only downfall of the entire experience. I would definitely stay with Sarah again!"
782,-2,"This was quite a disappointing Airbnb experience for my partner and me. Sean was extremely difficult to get in touch with prior to our arrival - we did hear from him but only briefly. As we were arriving after a four hour drive I tried to keep Sean informed of our arrival time, yet when we got to the apartment the sheets were still in the dryer in the basement of the building. While the sheets were clean the bathroom was anything but, the floor was covered in dirt. This was thankfully only a quick stop over for us but quite a disappointing stay overall. "
783,-1,"The location of the apartment is pretty good, nice street views. We arrived the place when the host was out so when we saw the apartment is a mess. However the host clean it up after we went out and came back at night. So cleanness is one of the problem of this stay. It is said there will be a second bed however it is under the queen bed and you have to drag it out. The sheet is not very clean, so many dust. In addition, the trash of the last person was not clean up. Both trash bin the in room and the bathroom were half full which is kind of disgust. There is a bag of rotten peach in the refrigerator and you won't want to use this kitchen. Overall the apartment location is great great great, but not clean."
784,-2,"Sean made us feel welcome, telling us we could leave our bags anytime after noon, even if he hadn't cleaned yet.  It appeared that was indeed the case because there was food in the frig, the paper towel roll was empty, there was hair in the bathtub drain, the blinds had so much dust you could draw a line in it and dust balls on the floor.  I let Sean know that we had dropped off our bags and would not be back until much later so he would have a chance to clean.  Unfortunately, nothing changed between 12:30 pm and 10:30 pm, which surprised us, but we felt it too late in the evening to call him.  
Also the place was much darker than the photos on line indicated. I guess they were overexposed."
785,-2,"First of all, the location was wonderful!  But that’s where the wonderful ends.
After climbing 3 flights of stairs hosting the most disgusting carpet I have ever seen, we arrived at our Beacon Hill efficiency – it was 2:45 pm and had not been cleaned yet which was OK so we had high hopes for the after effect. Wifi said it was working but was not able to connect to internet. I reported it to Sean and he said he’d look into it. We ended up using a WiFi device that used our cell phone signal.
We left to go out sightseeing, returning later that evening. Sean had been there because we found 2 clean towels and the bed was made.  The fridge still had someone else’s half eaten food in it. There were no glasses, only 1 Mason jar and some coffee mugs….which was ironic since there was no coffee maker! There were plates and cutlery, a microwave and a toaster oven, a fridge (no ice cube trays) and a stove. 
The apartment is in dire need of a facelift. There was trim falling off the baseboards, the entire place needs painting. Part of the wall in the awful bathroom appeared to be patched with white tape of some kind.  The light fixture over the sink lacked a cover – just a bare bulb.
The tub was awful – mildew lined the tiles and the tub was long overdue to be re-glazed. Some new floor tiles had started to be laid near the tub only which makes you wonder why.  Single ply toilet paper (1 roll).  The hand soap next to the sink was like water – instead of replacing it, water had been added to it.
Then we got ready to go to bed only to find there was no top sheet – a fitted bottom sheet and the nasty comforter was it!!  I found an unopened twin bed sheet in a package in a bin on the wall and promptly opened it and laid it across the bed to have a barrier from the comforter touching us. The bed itself was super hard – I think it was the box spring and not a mattress at all!
This place could have been fixed up pretty cute which is the sad thing.   It’s an old building and I know you can’t make it look new, but there is no excuse for this. We are Air B & B Superhosts and we have an 1882 carriage house that we rent out. Parts definitely look old but the parts we can do things about, like bathrooms, we have fixed up very nice.  This was a huge disappointment for a beautiful area of Boston.  I took photos of all the issues I noted if anyone cares to see them as proof as to what I noted.
"
786,-1,"Our communication with the host was by email/text.  There was no personal check in. 
Access to the room was by a lock box on a sidewalk railing around the corner from the room itself.
Entering the room, we saw dishes piled up on a drying rack and dirty standing water in the kitchen sink that was plugged off.  Opening the door under the sink (which had a broken hinge) we saw a plunger.
The bed was pushed over against an old electric wall heater that is located below the window.  The bed frame was supported on the window side of the bed by a gallon can of paint wit(URL HIDDEN)on top.
The mattress itself had a fitted sheet but no top sheet.  There was a  thin duvet (comforter) and no additional bedding provided.  There was a single bath towel and hand towel.
The general state of this place was such that we (my husband; a sewer plant electrician, and I) immediately booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Cambridge and for a $7.00 Uber ride and $10 more than for this room, we were rescued.
As we left the room we tossed the keys back into the room through the 1/2 inch gap between the top of the door and the door frame."
787,-1,"Bel appartement, propre et fonctionnel, bien situé à 10 minutes de marche de la station de metro et relativement proche du centre-ville. L'hôte s'est montrée très disponible et a répondu très rapidement à un problème d'eau chaude et de température de l'appartement. Le lendemain, tout était réglé. Le seul problème que nous avons rencontré et qui a été ennuyant durant notre séjour était l'absence de place de parking. Nous avons dû en chercher une dans un parking publique et cela revenait à 40 dollar/jour. Appartement à recommander ! Merci !"
788,-6,"First let me state that we booked our stay more than a month in advance. The apartment is in a great location, but be advised that it is on the third floor of building, essentially 4 flights of stairs up with no elevator. It was clean and well equipped. We requested a fan and a blow dryer and both were delivered the same day.  We were disappointed with the extent of ""Common Area Improvements"" that took place during our stay. Blackstone did notify us, but only gave us one week notice prior to our stay and no other possible place to find in such short notice. Sheet rock dust, rubble, paint fumes, noise... The extent of common area maintenance was ""grossly"" understated.  Work crew left building door propped open daily.  Drop cloths full of rubble to walk through. Our clothing and bodies were coated with dust both coming and going. Very noisy. Additionally, my daughter tripped on yellow ""caution"" tape placed by maintenance crew on our way out of building on our final day, fell down the marble entrance stairs with laptop in her backpack and her suitcase tumbling after... Fortunately she only incurred bruises. Unfortunately her new led touchscreen was shattered (just received at Christmas $800.down the drain)!!! I have had to wait to write this review so I could control my disappointment. I'm sure after renovation to the property is complete, it will be lovely to stay.  That is what took place- major renovation not common area maintenance. They tore out Sheetrock, light fixtures, wiring, etc. it was a mess! "
789,-1,"Das Beste an der Wohnung: Zentrale Lage, schöne Einrichtung, gute Gegend, toller Ausblick aus dem Fenster, gute Kommunikation, wie becshrieben

Minuspunkte: Sehr laut, das Fenster lässt sich nicht ganz schließen und daher kommt ein kalter Luftzug in die Wohnung, sehr hell, Utensilien wie Klopapier und Putzmittel warden nicht gestellt"
790,-2,"Duane a offert un accueil chaleureux et réconfortant. Il avait préparé tout le nécessaire pour que nous nous sentions à l'aise durant le séjour. Le matin, Duane a préparé son réputé café et son pain artisanal. Un délice! Il nous a fait sentir les bienvenus dans sa maison. La chambre est simple, mais c'est ce que nous cherchions parce que nous avons passé toute la journée à explorer Boston et les alentours. Merci pour l'accueil Duane!"
791,-1,"Duane est très accueillant. Propose du bon café et du bon pain maison. Nous avons apprécié de pouvoir discuter avec lui et avec Alex, un hôte présent en même temps que nous. La chambre est simple. La vue sur la Skyline est réelle mais relativement lointaine ! Nous pensons qu'il est préférable d'avoir une voiture pour louer cette chambre car les transports en commun sont assez loin. Surtout si vous avec des bagages lourds. Nous avions une voiture et c'est simple pour aller dans boston."
792,-1,"I consider that the room was little but good. The only issue is the noise. But to be honest, I had no problem with it. It's quite warmed but I would come back to stay."

794,-2,"Bei Andrea war alles sehr unkompliziert, was ich sehr zu schätzen wusste! 
Die Lage war für mich pervekt, ausserhalb und doch nah genug der Stadt, welche man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln sehr einfach und schnell erreichen konnte.
Zudem, und dies war in meinem Fall das Wesentlichste, er akzeptierte mich mit Hund und zwar, auf eben diese unkomplizierte, gute Art."
795,-1,The hallway needs to be cleaned or part of the description.  It's truly disgusting. 
796,-1,Nous avons eu un séjour agréable et tout ce que nous avions besoin. Nos hôtesses étaient gentille et on répondu à toute nos demandes. 
797,-3,"What I loved most was the view from my room. Ocean view! (And the beach was less than 5 min walk from the house!) 
Metro station is 15-20 min walk from the house, which is not bad at all. 
Just one thing kind of bothered me was the airplane noise. The reason I chose this place was because it's so close from the airport, (only 10 min by taxi) but one unpleasant thing about that was you hear the planes coming and leaving. It's not that loud but you can still hear. "
798,-1,"La casa se encuentra en un barrio muy bonito frente al mar, es una zona segura y tranquila.
Al principio tenía temor de regresar tarde por la zona, pero me di cuenta  que no hay problema alguno.
Pese a estar junto al aeropuerto no se escucha ruido de las aeronaves en la habitación, con lo cual se descansa comodamente.
Me pareció raro que la habitación no cuente con llave, lo cual al principio me tenia con dudas, pero no hubo ningun problema la casa es muy segura.
Recomiendo  a quienes desean estar cerca del centro de Boston y contar con transporte público cercano.


"
799,-1,"Is close to everything 
But not clean  room smell mold and bed is small and very uncomfortable
I will be more carefull what I choose next time ;-("
800,-1,"This is a good option for an overnight stay in Boston, very close to Logan and just a short walk from public transport.

As other reviews said, this is set up as a bed-and-breakfast with several rooms rented out, with shared bathroom, kitchen, and small living area (from which you can watch the planes at Logan). There's a code for the front door and rooms do not have locks. It was a bit startling when someone opened my bedroom door after midnight (likely looking for the bathroom).

The hosts sent detailed instructions via message and I had no problems. I did not meet them; after reading other reviews I didn't expect to.

If you're looking for a place to sleep for a layover, and you know this is what you're getting, it's a good deal. Don't forget to take your towel with you to the bathroom!"
801,-1,"The internet was slow.  Otherwise, I had everything I needed.  The place was clean and spacious.  I was there briefly, and never met the host.  They accommodated my last minute schedule change with no problem, and provided good directions.  One or two other reviewers here have complained about the lock, but I had no trouble with it.  You just need to push the latch harder with your thumb."
802,-5,"Robert's place was ridiculously cheap for the area and as a host he was very helpful in giving me information about the city and how to get around, he also provided me a clean towel which was nice.

The room didn't have a lock on the door but I wasn't too concerned. The bathroom was in the kitchen area, not next to the room so that was a little awkward but wasn't too bad. 

As for the condition of the room itself, it was a little dirty and had a strange smell, kind of a mix of mustiness and pets. I would say if you are looking for a cheap place to stay that's in a nice neighborhood, go for it--it was a five minute walk from public trans and the conference hotel that I had to go to every morning. But if creature comforts are your deal this is not the kind of room you go home to in order to recharge. It's bare bones--but at $90-something a night, that's expected. "
803,-1,Definitely read all of the reviews before booking if you are very particular about where you are staying. We stayed in the first floor room which wasn't bad- it's extremely old and pretty quirky but overall a large room and the apartment is on a BEAUTIFUL street and in a perfect location. The bathroom was VERY DIRTY - it literally a layer of dirt on the floor. The rest of the house was just as the reviews said.. full of books and smelled kind of funny. Robert was very nice even though we only met him briefly. They were also very accommodating and let us leave our luggage until later in the evening. 
804,-4,"
The location was perfect for walking downtown Boston, three blocks from Copley Square in the heart of Back Bay. Otherwise I cannot recommend the ground floor room, spooky, cluttered, and musty smelling, no mattress pad, two thin and very old tired pillows, no wash cloth provided, no drinking glass or paper cups in bathroom, two hangers on a close pole for clothing, cluttered room with poor lighting, bathroom shower door fell off its track onto my feet, poor lighting in bathroom and fan not working, no lock on bedroom door. Also, I wish the owner had informed me ahead of time that he was going to be away on vacation and that his housemate would be there instead."
805,-1,"Logement bien situé pour utiliser le transport en commun et prix abordable pour visiter Boston en comparaison aux hôtels. YuChen  nous laisse notre intimité sans problème, est joignable par téléphone et texto.
 La chambre est spacieuse, mais ne vient pas avec literie complète. Il est donc préférable d'apporter soit une couverture supplémentaire ou un sac de couchage lorsque nous sommes deux. Propreté passable, c'était plutôt poussiéreux dans la chambre et la salle de bain... La chambre ne se verrouille pas, alors que l'appartement est partagé avec d'autres voyageurs.
Cependant, considérant le peu de temps passé dans l'appartement, cette chambre demeure tout de même un bon choix en voyage."
806,-1,"Beautifully renovated apartment. Close walk to Southie's West Broadway. About a 15 minute walk to the convention center. A little loud for 6:30AM given it's proximity to a trucking area, but if you are headed out early to a convention, that might not bother you. The host was quite responsive to several small issues that came up, which he fixed the next day."
807,-2,"My experience was rather unpleasant. Yuan was a nice host but the place needed desperate cleaning. There was hair in most of the hallways. Bathrooms and kitchen were very dirty. Also, the room didn't have a fan so it was very hot most of the night. Overall I would have actually preferred sleeping in my car and passing up this house because it was too dirty. "
808,-7,"This place was small, cramped, and very dirty. The bathroom was so dirty that I went out and bought cleaning supplies to use it. The room itself was covered in cat hair and there was CAT LITTER all over the ground. The bed is extremely unstable and would squeak at the slightest hint of movement. I spoke to one of the people who lived there and they explained to me that roughly nine other people lived there, which included people sleeping on the couches in the living room. The place smelled like pot every single day of the two weeks that I was there, which makes sense as the permanent tenants are all students. The smoke detector had been taken off of the ceiling in my room and put in the drawer of the dresser in the room. The room was off the kitchen, separated by windows with blinds covering them, which they don't show in the picture for obvious reasons. Seriously this place was awful and felt unsafe. Spend the extra $20 a night and stay somewhere else. "
809,-1,"toRena m'a très bien accueillis, la chambre était telle que montrée sur les photos.  Son mari aussi a été très hospitalier, s'informant quotidiennement si tout était ok pour moi.

Le secteur est bien, facilement accessible avec les autobus.  Un stationnement est disponible dans la rue, ce qui est très pratique si on arrive en voiture, ce qui était mon cas.

Les lieux était très propre, avec accès à la cuisine.

J'ai bien aimé mon expérience!  Si retourne à Boston, je vais surement la contacter de nouveau. "
810,-1,Lucille was accommodating in welcoming us. We were able to correspond with her throughout our trip with a delay in air travel and a late night arrival. She was even up late and welcomed us. Lucille is very kind. 
811,-5,"Be careful staying with Nick. While he was a nice guy, there were several inaccuracies in his posting when I stayed in his place. When I booked, there were misrepresenting stock photos up, not the real apartment. He sent real photos only after my plane landed in Boston. A few days before the trip, he raised the price since my time there was inconvenient for him. The description was also flawed. The space is a run down studio about 15-20 minutes from downtown Boston on public transportation. The building is a mess. There's graffiti on the wall of the elevator that says, ""Fix this fucking building,"" and posters asking if residents are having trouble with mice. Neighborhood seems a little seedy, but off beat if that's what you like. Definitely overpriced for the quality. He uploaded the real photos of the apartment after I complained to him, and Airbnb actually refunded part of my trip. There is wifi and a Rocu, which is nice. "
812,-3,"I had to o clean the place (counter tops, floor) by myself before AND after. The plant by the corner of the living room continuously shed its leaves and i had to clean that to clean that up and it would get stuck to myhands and finger nails. I also had to clean the fridge of old food and drinks and salt spilt on the table top. I did all the dishes as well because the wine glasses were extremely dirty. 
I also had to wait outside the house for  her arrival for well over 45 minutes. When i finally came into the house, the place was neither clean nor ready for accommodation. the heater also made extremely loud ticking noise. we could not sleep deepily because of that. ironically, heater didnt even work. the floors were cold and so was the air, especially the room
the explanation of the place is also extremely misleading. I rented it because the description said the whole apartment. however, your place have absolutely NO privacy whatsoever. What is beyond me is that there is a single door between your place and our bedroom. the description absolutely is  misleading. To make things worse, the door to the bathroom doesnt even have a lock. who has a privacy in this sort of space?
She alsp tried making me pay for 5 people when only 2 people stayed. she also said it is community and food id suppose to be in the fridge. it is NOT community when the milk in the fridge has already expired! "
813,-1,"Overall great experience staying at Frank’s place for a weekend. The place was just as described and was a sweet little refuge from the cold weather and wet snow outside. Not to mention, great location! My girlfriend and I had a great stay. 

And if you have a severe anxiety issue with bed linen and towel cleanliness as I do, this place gets a big thumbs up!

Pro tip: Try the chocolate store around the corner for a saweeeet chocolate mocha"
814,-1,L'appartement était très bien situé. Son emplacement permet de visiter la ville à pied très facilement. L'hôte était sympathique. Il était disponible en tout temps par téléphone si nous avions des questions.
815,-1,"Please note that this is an apartment of an indoor smoker. While Nawab was very accommodating with a cleaning crew when he learned of my discomfort, I only stayed because I was locked in due to price and time constraints.  "
816,-1,"Nick et Fal ont été très accueillants et chaleureux. Tout était soigneusement préparé pour notre arrivée et nous n'avons manqué de rien. La chambre et la salle de bain sont dans un espace relativement indépendant dans la maison, ce qui nous a permis de nous y sentir très libres. "

La salle d'eau est commune, mais il n'y a aucun souci de propreté ou d'occupation. Tout est très soigné. 
Sean est vraiment très gentil. Il nous a fourni beaucoup de détails sur les lieux à visiter, les endroits où se régaler ( breakfast,  restaurants, pubs, etc..), les choses à découvrir ( parcs, parade,de,St Patrick, etc..). C'est un hôte très charmant et attentionné. 
Nous recommandons vivement la chambre de Sean pour ceux qui veulent découvrir Boston et ses alentours."
818,-1,"Location was good in sense of proximity to T station. Room was ok but was really cold. Too many windows in the room might be good for daytime but became problem for outside traffic noise making it hard to sleep. This is my first experience with Renting a Room, don't think will ever look  into room rental. Worth to pay little more for comfort."
819,-2,"Wentao went out of his way to meet me and give me the keys since he was going away for the weekend. He came back the day before I left and I never heard him at all. I was going for location and price. I got that. However, I was not prepared for a 4 flight walk up. As a result I stayed out all day and only came back to sleep. Although warned about the street noise I was not prepared for the intensity. Summer and no AC necessitated open windows. Although he was a kind host, the quality of the lodging, the stairs and the noise would prevent me from staying there again. "
820,-1,She stayed up late - airline delays due to thunderstorms - to let me in.
821,-1,"C'est un appartement très pratique car situé tout prêt du métro, vraiment à 1min à pied. Simple mais complet, on peut y faire un peu de cuisine. J'ai trouvé cela très bien pour notre court séjour sur Boston (une nuit), le seul point négatif étant la fenêtre qui ne ferme pas (la rue est assez passante). "
822,-6,"I don't recommend this place. The studio is tiny, hardly any floor space once you have the two beds folded out. It wasn´t very clean and the shower is old and moldy. it's OK if you just want to sleep though and the area and public communications into Boston are OK. 
What really upset me and my friend however was that it was so difficult to get in touch with Sean on arrival. As we entered the US, we had to wait 1,5h (!) at border control (we are European citizens) and we immediately texted Sean that we would be late. We sent several texts, informing him. He never replied. We were really worried as it was nearing midnight and we hadn´t heard from him. We decided to find the studio, praying that he'd be there waiting for us. 

When we arrived he simply said, ""ah, I saw your text, but I didn't reply since it would cost me"". This made both me and my friend furious, it was just so extremely arrogant to have us worrying like that, tired, late in a foreign city. I understand that he has lots of guests and that it's costly to text people, but hey, ONE SINGLE text, how expensive can it be? it left a very bad impression on me and I'd never recommend this place to anyone. "
823,-1,"Positive points: this very small flat (definitively for a single) is well situated, very close to a T station linked to downtown in 15mn.
Negative: it requires to be refurbished urgently: very old, numerous failures, electric network outdated and dangerous, but it is also dirty (room and washroom). Sean do not do the minimum after each stays. Additionally, you are not allowed to switch off the old PC, so you have the noise made by the CU all along the night (+ the fridge noise, plus the dropping tap + the roar of the avenue...): don't miss your ear plugs.
I met a stressed Sean 15 mn on arrival and bye-bye. No guest book in the room with key informations and advices...
Sean is not fair enough and do not fulfill the Airbnb minimum requirements. 
The price is good... until you discover the reality."
824,-5,"Please read this review before you consider booking this place! Also please note that I am yet to leave a bad review on yelp. My partner and I have been travelling with airbnb stops for about the last 4 months and are not at all fussy travellers. 
The apartment is not what it seems when you book it.
Pictures-
The pictures on the site do not clearly represent the apartment. The photos are spaciously deceptive and do not  give a true representation of what we found when we arrived. There is not room for one person to be comfortable here let alone two travellers with suitcases. The pictures did not show how two people would have to sleep - with one on a mattress on the floor. The pictures also do not portray the state of the apartment - the kitchen and bathroom were both not in the condition in which we found the place.


Cleanliness-
The place was not acceptable to live in. It was disgusting. The bathroom tiles are filed with mould and rust and dust. The floors are all covered with dust and look like the place has never seen a broom before. I could never allow for a places would stay in to get like that let alone to leave it in such a state and have the nerve to let someone else stay there. It is an embarrassment to do such a thing. The kitchen was also disgusting and left uncleaned from when it was last used. It was in such a state that we did not feel comfortable to use the facilities. 

Overall it was a disgusting place to stay in where we can barely fit ourselves in let alone all of our luggage. I definitely do NOT recommend for anyone to stay here. We payed an outrageous price to stay in such a place - one of our most expensive stops on our trip and with out a doubt the worst. "
825,-1,"Pros: 
- good location
- easy access to public transportation
- wireless internet, running water, lights turn on
- host was prompt with responses via email/text/phone
- reasonable price

Cons:
Despite what the host says, there are STILL bed bugs at this apartment. My friend and I found bugs EVERY, SINGLE night and woke up with bites. I took pictures of the bugs too and would post it up if it were possible. When the problem was addressed to the host  in person at the end of my stay, he came off as defensive and kept repeating the fact that he had hired someone to get rid of the bed bugs already. But at the end of the day, there are still bed bugs so it doesn't matter to me if someone was hired to exterminate the bugs already. I understand that this place was fairly inexpensive to rent, but the apartment was dusty and bug infested. I had to frantically wash all my clothes and sheets when I got home. "
826,-2,"We spent a night in this room on 25 Aug 2013 (sorry we could not report earlier), and we were bitten by BED BUGS (more than 30 bites in total on various body parts), so they are NOT gone. 

Unless the owner can guarantee that the flat has been professionally sanitized (replacing the mattress is not sufficient), I would absolutely AVOID this place for the moment. We had to wash/dry/isolate all clothes and deal with ugly bites on a holiday trip... not funny. 

Apart from that the room is small (as expected) and rather dirty (not acceptable). The location is good, very close to public transport."
827,-3,"Sean's place was a kind of a disappointment for us. The place is small as described, but that's not the problem. The real issue is the big amount of dirt we found all over the place. The freezer reeks and is so dirty that we found it impossible to use. The location though is awesome. There are plenty of good places to eat around, not to mention there is a train station nearby. The thing is if you're looking for cleaness and a big room thats definetly not the place, but if your budged is low and you're trying to be well located, go for it.
"
828,-2,"We ended up wasting our money on this booking as Sean did not meet us at our scheduled meeting time.  Over an hour later and after several calls, Sean showed no urgency to get to the apartment. We were willing to wait when he said he was on his way, but when we called him later and he was still doing other things, we decided to seek accommodation elsewhere. We were extremely disappointed by Sean's careless attitude after a long journey to get to Boston. "
829,-2,"Communication with the host was satisfactory. The Apartment was very disappointing. There was no stopper for the bath or basin and the basin faucet dripped all the time. The cover was missing from the extract fan which was clogged with dust. The bed was a mattress on the floor. My wife and I are 68 and fortunately we are both fit but the mattress would have been a problem for a less able couple.The smoke detector in the bedroom was hanging from the ceiling  secured by the electrical wiring. Both blinds in the bedroom were broken and did not operate. There was mold on the bathroom tiles.Only one element on the cooker worked. The whole apartment would have been vastly improved with a decoration and attention given to the above points none of which would have involved large financial expense.
I would not recommend this apartment to anyone."
830,-2,"We stayed at the apartment for one night. Sean was helpful and accurate in the information provided, although we did not meet. At the time of booking we were aware of the small size of the study and mattress left on the floor (learned from previous reviews); the only positive aspect that we found was the proximity to public transportation.
The apartment was awfully dirty: stained mattress cover and probably unwashed, half an inch of dust everywhere, from shutters to tables and kitchen. On the floor of the bathroom we found several hairs, half-finished bars of soap and detergents that probably dated back to a few years ago. From the ceiling dangled the smoke detector. Finally, the noise coming from the street was rather annoying.
Concluding this apartment does not reflect the photos presented on AirBNB, as already reported by other users. Boston is expensive, so we opted for this solution (relying on the photos and on some good reviews). Certainly We didn't expect a hotel service but certainly not the situation in which we found ourselves. We wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone.
"
831,-1,"The room is old and pictures are outdated and misleading. There isnt bed, just matress on the floor."
832,-2,"We stayed 3 nights at the studio and there are so many things to say..
this studio does not meet basic standards of cleanliness and safety, Airbnb should not allow to rent such a place. The low price can not justify it! That was easy to get the keys, probably the only good point of this Airbnb (with the location, close to subway station). The rest was UNACCEPTABLE, and we contacted Airbnb to let them know, the pictures were taken probably many years ago, and the flat is not like in the pics. It was dirty, and mostly NOT safe. Even for the ""price"" that is ok, this is not possible to rent a flat like that !!!  I took a lot of pictures that I am going to send to Airbnb to prevent this flat. 

MAIN ROOM: 
- 1st day, we saw a cockroach on the floor (even if the building is old), that is not possible !!
- wall lamp in the room is broken (not like in the picture). 
- the studio is old but the main problem is the level of disrepair, dirtiness (water splash on the door of the bathroom), and safety (electrical outlet where it's written ""do not unplug"" , why ??) 
- I m not going to detail everything (old computer on the floor that takes place for nothing, foam insulation on the wall, etc)
- kitchen and bath are dirty and outdated 
- ceiling lamp with visible wires (very dangerous!) 
- the fridge was not emptied by previous renters 

Bathroom:
- broken ventilation in the bathroom is very dusty but still works (really unsafe)
- there is some mold on the bathroom's ceinling and some sanitary napkins to contain it !!! (this is more than dirty !!!)

For sure we were expecting a small and basic studio (as the pictures are showing) but not such an unhealthy place. This is unacceptable 
Pierre"
833,-1,"Communication with Sean was very good and helpful, we did not have any problems to find the apartment and get into it. The Apartment itself was disappointing: extremely small and run down and somewhat shabby, especially the bathroom. Bed is very uncomfortable and too small for two. The photos are very well made... And one needs earplugs as the busy street is very close and the neighbourhood is loud.
Good: Towels, conveniently located and the breakfast place around the corner."
834,-1,"I had to fly to Boston for a medical emergency. Sean responded to my accommodation request immediately and, in fact, responded to all my communications quickly. I really appreciated not having to worry about where I was staying so that I could attend to my daughter. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in his place again"
835,-2,"Sean was not at the location when I arrived despite having been called three times to alert him to the time of my arrival.  The key was not in the lockbox.  I waited in the cold rain for him to come with the key to let me in.  Upon entering the studio the previous tenant's used sheets and towels were in a pile on the bed.  Sean left me in the apartment while he went to the laundry in the basement to wash everything.  It was a good hour from the time I initially arrived outside until I was able to occupy the space.  It is, as I expected for the price, a spartan space, but it needs a thorough cleaning.  Sticky table, dusty lamp, dirty soap dish.  Sean warns of a leaky faucet in the bathroom, but it is more like a cascade of hot water pouring from the faucet.  Sean is a very nice man, however, and will rectify these problems for the next occupants, I hope."
836,-5,"We hesitated a lot before writing this comment because we fand Sean really nice and kind: we met him upon our arrival as he was finishing preparing our flat. The bed sheets and towels have been changed. The first impression of the flat was that we have been trapped!!!
The appartment is definitly is a very bad shape and shall be completly refurbished: questionnable electrical installation (cables repaired with band,...), broken stores, ceiling in the bathroom almost falling down, ventilator in the bathroom also broken. The bed was even funny : the feet are composed of 2 superimposed shoe pairs on one side and a rechargeable battery on the other (!). But okay, what do you expect for this price ? This was indeed not was shocked us with this flat.
The worst part was the dirt. And even for such a price you can expect the flat to be cleaned !!! The floor was full of dust and of hairs (different sizes and colors so it was probably not only from the former guest unless they've lived with 5 people here).
The bathroom was covered with moisture, the electrical plate and the oven were black with dirt, the fridge had brown motives made of a fluid which one fell on it, the walls and the doors were covered with traces of liquid which made flowing motives when drying. We tried to clean the dust from the table to check if it had just not been cleaned for one or two days: it was actually fixed by months or years of quiet sedimentation...
Clear NO GO, even for the price!"
837,-1,"Terrible room.
Don't go there..."
838,-8,"Avoid this place. It felt like a very run down dorm room in a dirty building. The air conditioning cooled the room but the ball bearings are going so it made loud screeching noises periodically throughout the night. Thankfully I had ear plugs along. The bed ""frame"" is made with 4 2x4/s holding up the sagging mattress. The sink is not just leaky it is constantly on (hot at that) - an example of what is wrong with this place. This place was steps below the worst motel I have ever stayed in.  I also am bothered by staying in places where after paying I get informed that I should not let anyone in the place know that I am with airbnb - we were afraid the manager, who kept staring at us, would ask questions and kick us out. "
839,-2,"
I was very dissatisfied with the apartment. The faucet continuously drips interfering with sleep. The place is generally not clean including small flying insects. I wonder when the bed covering was last washed.  I was struck at how little cleaning was done between tenants. There are missing covers on smoke detectors and fans. Tape on wires. There is mold on the patched up tile in the bathroom. There is not one comfortable seat in the place. It is noisy--ambulances, subway, auto horns (also making sleep difficult). The building is generally run down and poorly cared for.  
Putting a few architectural drawings on the wall does not make it an architect's studio. 
"
840,-1,"I and my wife stayed at Sean's studio. We did not meet Sean himself, but there were no issues with letting ourselves in, and he was great with answering our queries via email. We found the apartment in a clean condition when we arrived. The neighborhood is really nice, with several shops and eateries, and appeared to be quite safe. There were a lot of supplies (tea, coffee, milk etc) kept in the fridge and the kitchen cabinets. The only major issue in the apartment really is the bathroom faucet, which is leaking quite profusely. But we of course knew about this from prior reviews, and the noise from the faucet did not bother us once we closed the bathroom door."
841,-7,"This apartment is very run down with something wrong with almost everything. While this place is cheap, it's no excuse for its condition.

The tap in the bathroom leaks constantly and no matter how hard you turn it, it doesn't stop. The bathroom is also rather dirty and for some reason there a hole in the ceiling where a fan should be.

The bed is uncomfortable and difficult to sleep in, probably because flip flops are balancing it, the pillows aren't any better. 

On top of the bed being useless the road outside is quite loud so sleeping is difficult unless you're a heavy sleeper. The heating is temperamental with it going from cold to hot constantly during the night. There is also wires everywhere and with some of the electrical and handy work being questionable.

On the plus side (the only one), it's in a good location and easy to get everywhere in Boston."
842,-10,"Awful. I think its the worst place i have ever stayed in. Really after being in india for three months, paying sometimes 2-3 dollars a night i cant remember such an awful place.
I'll explain: on the day we arrived sean told us to be patient because maybe he wont change the sheets by the check in (URL HIDDEN) why it is the check in time??
There is absolutely no parking there if you are not a resident.
The building is old and dirty and realy not nice. When we got inside the apartment there was a cat leaning on the door. Suffocating feeling inside.
The apt is small, so small that i thought sean is a magician for taking pictures and making it look liveable. And if its so small why putting all this junk inside? 
And it was dirty like no one cleaned it. Hair and dust balls got stuck in my leg, twice.
The bed is not really a bed just a bunch of broken strings. We woke up every day with a backache. I tried to sleep on the floor (after cleaning it) but there was no room
There was soap for cleaning your hands but i guess buying a new one is too expensive so why not fill it with water?
The leak in the bathroom, just fix it, the sound of it with the overall atmosphere made me feel like a horror movie..
The vent is broken and the dirt on it is just disgusting, take a swab and send to harvard microbiology test
Ohh, but there is a drawing on the wall so its an architecht's studio..
The neighborhood is also not a nice one.

The plus side for the place  - close to the train and a good wifi

If you are a single young man with really no standarts you can come to this place otherwise do youself a favor and dont be tempted by the cheap price. Its really un-rentable and airbnb shouldnt let this place be rented. Go to the suburbs and take the train.

I should mention also that being so angry about this place we left it after half of the time. Screw the money. I have pictures and if anyone want i can send it"

844,-1,"Preste atenção ao fato de que o prédio é velho e está passando por reformas, e se você for ""ok"" com isso, poderá ter uma boa hospedagem. Passamos pouco mais de duas semanas em Boston, no final de dezembro, e essa unidade nos serviu muito bem. 
Houveram os inconvenientes da reforma tais como sujeira, homens trabalhando logo cedo, e eles precisando fazer reparos no nosso apartamento sem muito aviso prévio. Tivemos que passar um dia chuvoso todo na rua porque estavam trocando as janelas. Deixaram a poeira da obra para a gente limpar, mas até que as janelas ficaram muito melhores depois. 
Fora isso, o apartamento é bem decorado, aconchegante e suficiente para dois. Cama e travesseiros confortáveis, cozinha bem equipada. O banheiro não tem aquecimento, mas a temperatura e a pressão do chuveiro são boas. A limpeza quando chegamos era superficial, muita sujeira atrás dos móveis e nos cantos e as panelas precisam ser limpas antes de usar. 
O check in só pode ser feito às 3pm, com o Eddie, que foi bastante atencioso. Não vimos o Ahmed.
A localização é o ponto forte. Ao lado do parque, dos teatros, cinemas, restaurante, e das três linhas de metrô. Faz-se tudo com pouco tempo de caminhada ou com ônibus e metrô. "

The apartment was well situated in the theatre district near Boston Common.  Generally the apartment was well maintained.  However, bed sheets were not fresh and had been used by previous occupants.  Also, under bed was dirty and the bathroom was old.  The apartment has no views from the windows apart from walls just a few feet away.  It is therefore dark and gloomy inside although since we were out all the day this was not a problem.  Kitchen equipment did not include mugs/cups for drinking coffee/tea."
846,-3,"We had an awful experience with the Northeast host. First of all, we started trying to contact the host the day before our arrival to confirm the reservation and receive information on the check in process. We attempted to contact them via the Airbnb messenger, text, and phone call. We were an hour outside of Boston and had to contact Airbnb corporate for them to reach out to our host and alert them that we had been trying to contact them. Finally once Airbnb corporate contacted them they contacted us and had moved us to a different building than we booked and called it an 'upgrade'. Although the room was very clean and nice we had a huge issue with parking our vehicle. We asked prior to booking what the parking situation was and the host told us that parking was $10/night. This was a blatant lie and the result was ruining our entire vacation. Parking was in garages for a minimum $70 for a two night stay with zero access to our vehicle. When we contacted the host regarding this and seeking a solution they flat out ignored us and didn't contact us for the remainder of our trip. When we contacted them after our trip and expressed our issues they continued to ignore us and Airbnb was forced to step in and sort everything out. Do not stay with this host if you are hoping for proper customer service and communication, and also if you have a vehicle."
847,-1,"Amazing location just few minutes from the subway. Jay was really welcoming. The feel of the place was more like an hostel, many rooms and many people around. Only two full bathrooms, but it never was a problem for me. The attic room was a bit short in height, i could only stand at specific location. a weird smell (smoke or food) was still lingering. But all beds, sheets and comforters were clean. I didn't get a towel as it was mention in the description."
848,-1,Schöne&gepflegte Unterkunft und tolle Gastgeber! Auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert!
849,-1,"Nous avons vécu un très beau weekend à Boston et c'est en partie grâce à Mary et Barney. La maison était splendide et la chambre très spacieuse. L'endroit était propre et confortable, nous étions mieux que dans une chambre d'hôtel. Le petit déjeuner est venu compléter le tout pour rendre notre expérience parfaite. Nous étions à quelques minutes à pied du métro et des vélos en libre service (hubway). Merci Carney Family!"

851,-1,"Oh it's an agency that ""rents"" the apartments on the building... great experience...

A lot of noise from the indian students that live there and I had the impression that someone was always tring to break in."
852,-2,"The listing has been reported to the Boston Fire Prevention dept., there was a smoke detector that had been removed between the bedrooms, and several other empty brackets in the apartment, they are out of compliance according to who we spoke to.  We had no problem with the neighborhood, but wouldn't recommend the apartment to anyone with health issues getting around as the staircase is steep and narrow.  With the sloped floors in the bedroom, placing anything on the desk could mean you could lose it, ex. earrings.  The missing towel bar in the bathroom meant that all towels were hung in the bedroom closet, making the closet area less useful.  With air conditioning in only the living area, and 1 bedroom, means that someone will not be comfortable at night.  The scratched teflon on the pans made them something I didn't want to use, as well as the filth on the kitchen floor upon check-in, and the cabinet that was filled with bags that were stuck to it?!  The beds were not great, reminded me of my grandmother's antique from 30+ years ago, but I guess that's better than a bed that's rock hard.  Although Shawn was decent about getting back to us with a few things, we lost about an hour the first day just cleaning the apartment and washing the floor to make it palatable for our stay.  When you pre-pay for your vacation and visit, it doesn't make it easy to just walk away, so we made the best of it."
853,-3,"This is a tough one. Our experience at the home was okay. The home is in a decent location. We had a very interesting interaction with the host, however. We were told initially that there was a single live streaming video camera in the home that was centered in front of the TV solely for the purpose of the host monitoring the cleaning staff. Upon arrival, we were able to find more cameras that were actively recording the home. It was a bit unsettling, but as recommended by the host, we were able to place a coffee can around one of the cameras to obtain more privacy. We had a decent experience at the home, however it became obvious that the home was made strictly as a high traffic Airbnb property. The existing furniture was discount quality with some existing broken pieces and we were asked to check out early to make room for the next guests the same day. Other than that, the property was enjoyable. We were a 10 minute Uber ride from downtown and the host was considerate enough to provide snacks and drinks for our stay. The worse part of our experience came at the conclusion of our stay. We were contacted by the host and accused of breaking a cabinet door, staining a carpet and leaving the place a mess. We take a great amount of offense to these accusations. We appreciate the Airbnb experience and try very hard to treat each property like it was our own. We too have rental property and if someone were to come into one of our properties and treat it badly, we would not be happy to say the least. Admittedly, we left the beds unmade and dishes in the sink. We thought the $100 dollar cleaning fee that we paid would cover those things. Not to mention, we were told that the camera (turns out there was more one camera we were not told about) was for a 3rd party cleaning staff. We respectfully notified the host that we did not break a cabinet door, nor did we create a stain on the carpet, yet we were again accused of the same misdeed. This time, however the host retorted that he was the one in charge of cleaning the property and he was fully aware of the cabinet door's status prior to our stay. Now again, we did not break a cabinet door, however if you read between the lines, all of sudden the live streaming cameras throughout the property become much more unsettling. We were told the cameras were to monitor cleaning staff. Not to mention we were not told about all of the cameras in existence. So if the host is cleaning the property, what is the purpose of the camera? Maybe this was just an isolated occurrence. Nevertheless, we did not appreciate being falsely accused of disrespecting a property. Next time, due to this bad experience, we will take pictures of the property to..."

855,-1,Great area and great apartment! The only downside was that the floor was a little dirty. 
856,-2,"#1 problem: The place smells. Like gerbils or ferrets live there, which is fine, but it was difficult to deal with. There was alot of clutter outside of the home leading up to the entrance way, and in the hallways. As you can see from the photos those dark grey swipes of paint were someone being lazy and filling in holes and painting with a different paint. The whole situation was seemed a little odd. Bed was comfy tho."
857,-4,"This PLace is simply NOT suited as a bed and breakfast. It is not just dirty and smelly, it  is actually filthy and the entire house and particularly the hallways and staircases so full of garbage and clutter that it is actually impossible to carry a larger suitcase upstairs to your room. None f the doors can be locked, this including the bathroom/toilet which is a shared facility and full of other peoples toothbrushes, 10 empty shampoo bottles, hair, laundry and other clutter items. No lock on your room other.

859,-2,"Had a terrible time communicating to the host. Msgs sent on airbnb for directions came back with a standard copy paste even more confusing directions in broken English. Email sent to host email address bounced and texts were never responded. Calls rarely attended or returned.

I had to take this place just for a night and I took this place due to the proximity to my meeting place. I managed to land at the door and while on taxi I called Robert to update him that am on the way and the response I got was ""ok""

When I landed there I was searching for the door number and then a guy came out from the basement and was kind enough to take the bags to the third or fourth floor of the building. Thankfully it was a small bag else it will be a disaster in that narrow, dingy steps with thousands of books on the sides. Some scary antique stuff as well. It was like a museum. "

861,-4,"My husband & I were met by Kevin, a friend of Eddie's at the address given to us, but were escorted across the street, behind a locked gate & down some stairs to basement in a different building. I am sorry to say I was very disappointed with the studio.  We found the studio in need of cleaning and repairs. The carpeting was heavily stained and had not been vacuumed. The musty smell was probably from the large leaks in the bathroom which had buckled the paint.  I did voice my concerns with Kevin and called Eddie but he informed me all other properties they had were booked.  They did offer another of their properties for the following night.  By this time it was evening. I could not stay in the condition it was in, and I feared the next place would be in the same condition. We found another B&B and left. 

I spent over $700 for 3 nights (the $89 price is seasonal, I guess). When I requested my money back I was informed of the strict refund policy - 7 day cancellation policy. Problem is, I wanted to stay there until I saw it's condition. Alan wrote me to say many other people had stayed there & loved it, so it was just 'my opinion' not 'let me get someone over to clean it', but that I was being unreasonable. 

The studio is in a great area - close to lots of wonderful places to see in Boston. I would have loved to be able to stay there had in been clean & repaired."
862,-16,"It’s basically like staying in a hot, old, dirty, and loud furnace room; stay somewhere else! (We were also surprised that none of this information came out in other reviews and somehow we paid $200 a night for this experience.)

The apartment was in a great location, but that’s about all it has going for it. It took only a few minutes before we realized how dirty it was. The carpet has taken on a light dirt color and the bathroom and kitchen linoleum was very sticky and gross. The paint in the bathroom has bubbled out and is starting to fall off (no fan for the shower). In the bathtub we were greeted by an alive cockroach stuck on its back waving its antennae in distress. My boyfriend looked for something to end its misery and found a dust pan in the closet. We quickly realized the “maid service” hadn’t used the dust pan anytime recently; when he picked it up there was a dead and dried-out cockroach underneath!

We decided to leave and drown our sorrows in Italian food and wine. If you make the mistake of staying here and want to do the same, the place is called Grotto and is amazing!

When we came back we were greeted by what seemed to be the heat of a thousand suns, but was just the radiator. We looked for a thermostat only to realize there wasn't one. There’s only one temperature, “hot and sweaty” and the only way to adjust it is to open the door and let the cold air come in. The cockroach battle was futile, we learned the next morning that they enter through the drain in the bathtub/shower. This could be fixed by installing a 50 cent drain cover, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like a priority.

The last thing I’ll note is the noise. There are some pipes which kick on and off every ten minutes and make an annoying pumping sound while clanking against the wall and TV stand. The fridge is old and loud, its compressor kicks on every 20 minutes or so. You’ll hear every time the upstairs neighbor takes a step. There’s also a loud dripping sound that comes from above as well, it lasts for about 5 minutes at a time and repeats in 30 minute intervals. The final noise to note is a really random one that we heard a few times during night, it sounds like ceiling is going to collapse and end your misery. If you want to sleep, make sure to bring ear plugs!"
863,-3,"Our host Eddie, not Alan, met us at the door which was a basement apartment. During our stay, we had a major flood through the ceiling of the bathroom. Unfortunately, I was going to the bathroom so I was drenched in ick water from the upstairs. We called Eddie at 2:00am and it wasn't until the following afternoon he relocated us to another place out by the airport- across the bay! Eddie was more concerned that we didn't tell neighbors it was Airbnb. We left on Wednesday even though we paid through Saturday. Worst experience ever! Do not stay there!!!"
864,-3,"This is my first experience with Airbnb.  We stayed for 4 nights.  I want to share honestly with you so that you can make an informed decision.  
Alan (host) was very responsive to all of my communications.  When we arrived, Alan’s associate Eddie met us at the apartment and was there quickly.  We went to the listed address but it is listed incorrectly so, as others have mentioned, we were led across the street from the listed location.  Maybe it should be listed as 5-1/4th.  As mentioned in previous reviews, we were led through a gate and down 2 or 3 steps to a “basement” apartment which is common to the area.  My only negative comment here is that the little alley-way the entry sits in is in need of a good sweep with a broom!  It would not take much effort or costs to make it far more inviting – charming even.  
The location is excellent!  It is one block from Boston Common and one block from the Massachusetts State House.  Across the common is the Park “T” (green) stop and in the other direction it is 3 or 4 blocks from the Bowdoin “T” (blue) stop.
I made the reservation months ahead and went in and read recent reviews just before we left.  I was alarmed to see the negative reviews regarding a water leak, bugs, and cleanliness issues.

The carpet is oatmeal colored and shows every spot and it was dirty.  

There were no bugs.

The bathroom is atrocious!  Clearly they did not intend for there to be a water leak but it needs to be repaired.  Additionally, the corners and edges around the bathtub were very funky.  Clorox Clean-up and a good scrub brush would work wonders!  There may be health violations where the bathroom is concerned.

I paid almost $1,000 for this stay and not only was I not forewarned by Alan that there was a problem but I also think that an adjustment should be made to my bill.  They even charged me a “cleaning fee” of almost $100.  I do not have the wherewithal to pay for accommodations twice while going about negotiations to get my money back.  And as a result I felt forced to stay in the apartment.

I think that Alan should have contacted me (and you) ahead of time to indicate that there is a problem and at the very least offer to reduce the listing price and offer a partial refund IF I were to choose to stay there in spite of the problems in the bathroom rather than charge full price for the stay. 

And lastly, two of us were there for 4 nights and only 4 towels were provided for our entire stay.  And, please note that the subway runs under the building or at least very nearby and you can hear and feel the movement of the trains.

Safe travels y’all.

865,-1,"Eddie was waiting for us and made sure we had all the information we needed.  The neighborhood is lovely, and close to everything.  The description is not as accurate as it could be.  The street shown is not where the apartment is.  It is a fairly dark airless space.  Can't imagine this room in hot conditions.   The kitchen, bedding and towels were clean, but the floors were disgusting.  Continuous dripping hot water tap in bathroom was noisy, and made the room steamy.   Was disappointed in the standard of this apartment for the price.  "

Merci et bonne continuation. "
867,-1,A big mess. Room was not prepared as we arrived and everything was very dirty. We did not get any cover sheet although we repeatedly asked for it as we also asked to clean the dirty bathroom and toillet... The answer was: this is not a hotel!!!!

869,-1,"The house is in a good position, 10-15 minutes from downtown with the metro. The public spaces in the apartment are good. The room was clean even though kinda smallish (but that is something you can tell from the picture). Overall I think it was a little expensive for what we got. We had a bad experience the first night (even though it wasn't the owner's fault) when an altercation between one of the other person that was in the house and a girl resulted in a window being broken with a stone. We were waken up at 3 in the morning by the police outside of our room. It wasn't a big deal (and to be honest, it was St Patrick's day and these things can happen) but it definitely didn't make our first night the best possible one. "
870,-1,The bathroom door lock is broken. Had to put a sticker on the door to use the bathroom.

We had the room at the attic. It was very hot and stuffy  in the room when wie arrive but you the room has a A/C so it wasn't a huge problem! 
The bathrooms were not so clean as described.
But the room has a big tv with Amazon Prime and Netflix access, that was great!
A very big fault was, that nobody told us about the change of the password of the front door, so we were stocked outside in the evening with the wrong password. 
We were lucky  that we had met our room neighbor one day before. So we'd contact him and he opened up the door.
Nevertheless the apartment is great located and you need only 10mins to downtown."

The only problem I had was that we we're awaken at 2:30am because of loud conversations inside the house, and all the lights were turned on. I don't believe it was done maliciously, but please be consious of those around seeking to have a good night sleep. I was not able to get one that night."

The flat is nicely designed, with a very nice bedroom and a brand new bathroom. 
It is a little obscure as it gives on a back yard but it was not too annoying as we were out during the day, wandering in the North End district, the very alive district of Boston
It seems all the flats of the building are short rentals, which has the disadvantage of having noisy neighbors partying some days.
But overall, it was a good experience.

879,-6,"Izzy's place was absolutely not what we expected! It was in a creepy location I did not feel safe, the house was disgusting and a mess, the bathroom was gross. The room had one window we could not open and it was stuffy and sticky inside! We could not wait to leave the place! I travel using airbnb in a regular basis and this was by far the worst place I have ever stayed! My suggestion DO NOT RENT THIS PLACE! Also paying 75 was an absolute waste the next night we got a hotel for 60 that was 110% better! "
880,-1,"Die Unterkunft bei Izzy war toll. Es war sehr sauber und man hatte alles zur Verfügung, was man braucht.  Der Selve-Check-In hat problemlos funktioniert. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und es wurden frische Handtücher bereit gelegt. In der Umgebung gab es sehr nette Restaurants und die U-Bahn ist in etwa 7 Gehminuten erreichbar. "
881,-2,"The room we stayed in was Room C. It was different than it was on the pictures. The room was clean and so was the bathroom even while shared with other guests. What bothered us was the dirty staircase and kitchen. We did not feel like using the kitchen when we saw all the dishes in the sink. Also, the host that was present did not say goodbye to us which was kind of sad. All in all, our one night stay in Boston was okay. Some things could have been better/improved."
882,-1,"Die Unterkunft war gut gelegen vor allem weil wir früh zum Flughafen mussten. Das Zimmer was sauber und geräumig und hatte alles was man benötigt. Parken war ebenfalls kein Problem, auch wenn man mal auf eine Nebenstraße ausweichen musste. Küche und Wohnzimmer waren groß und hatten ebenfalls alles  was man benötigt. Der einzige Kritikpunkt ist vielleicht, dass es für mehrere vermietete Zimmer nur ein Badezimmer gibt, wo es vor allem abend und morgens zu Staus kam ;) Ansonsten hat alles problemlos funktioniert;) "

884,-1,"In the apartment it was very dirty .
we walked in and there instincts to rotten melon .
the sink was full of dirty dishes.
the microwave and mini oven were dirty you could make it nothing to eat.
on the herd was a coffeepot with moldy coffee.
on the first day of our ""vacation"" we first had to make everything clean that we can feel comfortable.
carissa wanted the city to show us what to do something .
But in the week she was not at home , and when they came home she was for days in her room she only came out to make himself something to eat and dishes piled up again."
885,-2,"The room: The description of the room was quite correct (only a bed and a desk in there) besides the fact that the apartment was dirty and stinking. They also did not mention huge ants (2cm) running around in the room and on the bed. The bed is not a real bed, this is a wrong statement - it was only stapled old mattresses. The bathroom was very dirty and you could not enter it without flip flops. The kitchen was alright in terms of equipment and size, however the trash was not emptied which is why it stank horribly in the apartment. All in all I was worried I would catch an infection staying there.

My host did not respond to my emails one day before I arrived and did not respond to two of my calls on the day of check in. So I was waiting in the heat in front on the porch until a neighbor was so nice to give me water and call him again, when he finally showed up. He explained me how to get to the metro, which was nice but he did not have a city map or other recommendations for Boston. After the check in I never saw him again. 

The neighborhood is run down and I did not feel safe walking home alone when it was dark. However it is conveniently located next to the metro - only 5 minutes walk so it is a short risk of being subject to crime. 
What was lovely was that it is also close to the beach (even though the host said it would not be able to go there - incorrect), so you can have a nice run at a very beautiful scenery.

You do not get to see the host besides the check in, he seems to rent out the whole apartment to people through Airbnb, but I barely saw anyone so it was nice to have some solitude when I was in the apartment."

888,-13,"The young host was welcoming but the accommodation was best suited to an undergraduate student rather than an adult traveller. Cramped. Dark. Cluttered. Warned to lock and chain door of bedroom. Bathroom cluttered with clothing on a rack. No window blind in the bathroom so no privacy. Unable to determine cleanliness or otherwise of the apartment because of the lack of light in the area. However, as advertised - next door to the museum of Fine Arts. The building is run down and unwelcoming. Weird decor combined with incense smell covering cigarette odour. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe. I was unable to find alternative accommodation due to my late arrival on the first night. Good preparation  possibility consisted of an electric hotplate in the bedroom and a microwave in the wardrobe. Fire risk was minimized by having a fire escape outside the window. Unpleasant accommodation. Not recommended. I should have asked for a photograph. After booking the host apologized saying he had been hacked -however it would appear someone of his friends had added comments to the booking dialogue that I could only describe as obscene. If I wasn't traveling on a strict budget I would have canceled. I have emerged to tell the tale but I honestly thought airbnb had certain standards that could be taken as assured. This experience says differently and I am hesitating to try airbnb again. I feel embarrassed that I actually went ahead and stayed at such inappropriate accommodation. I hope to receive an explanation from airbnb why such accommodation is on their books at a more expensive rate than in NY.  Travellers beware!!!"
889,-3,"I booked this room for 5 days because I was going to a workshop very close by.  Boston is expensive, so would tolerate a lot not to spend on those pricey hotels.  The apartment did feel very cramped, dark, with a spooky vibe.  Again, I was going to tolerate all this for the price and convenience. On the second night I saw a mouse.  That did it for me. Next day I found other accommodations.  I asked for a two night reimbursement, which Trevon did immediately.  FYI, I found a great airbnb in Newton Center, which is a 10 minute T ride to the Fenway area.  Wish I had known about that earlier. "
890,-2,"The place was perfect for my short trip to boston. The city is insanely expensive and Trevon's place is perfect to avoid going broke. 
I did not know you could fit so many things in a room. It has everything you need - bed, A/C, nice music on the TV when you walk in, water both cold and at room temp (very thoughtful!), extra key, microwave, fridge. To some the room may be cramped but even the sheraton has really small rooms in boston (and for $300).  
Thanks Trevon!"
891,-1,"Pros: great location, green line train stop right in front of the apartment building. Host provides a fridge with bottled water in the room. 

Cons: strong cigarette smell. My throat felt like it was closing the entire time I stayed there. All my clothes were covered with the cigarette odor. 

Warns: on the day I checked out, Trevon was yelling and cursing loudly with someone in the next room for about 30 minutes. This argument was so intensified that I even thought about calling 911. But I was afraid my schedule had to be delayed if I got involved since I needed to catch the flight. Instead, I left the key, and sneaked out of the apartment as soon as possible. This is so far the worst Airbnb experience I have ever had.     "
892,-3,"The entire apartment smells of strong cigarette smoke despite the countless air fresheners. I was attending a conference and colleagues were commenting on the scent of my clothes. I found a cellphone in my bed (under my pillow) that wasn't mine during the first night, do I have concerns about how/if the room was even prepped for me. The bathroom was almost unusable as the sink had no pressure and the rest was filthy. 

Air conditioning was great in the room however, there was definitely privacy, and the location was central. I arrived very late and the host was accommodating. 

If cleanliness ranks low and perhaps have another location to brush your teeth, then this place is for you. I will not be returning."
893,-6,"Unfortunately my stay wasn't as great as I expected. The wrong house number was listed and I was unable to reach Liz for quite a while.  I found out later on she was away skiing for the weekend.
Once I got into the apartment I was please. Very clean and a lovely apartment.

Then I the pipes were frozen so we had no running water or bathroom facilities (it's January it happens) I called Liz again no answer.. So I text her to tell her the pipes were frozen. She replied immediately and told me to raise the heat that might help. 
So Myself and my guest had to leave the apartment to go to our event with not being able to shower or use the bathroom after 5 hours bus journey. At this stage I wished I had book a hotel.

My guest came back to the apartment early as she was coming down with a cold/ flu. When it came time to go back to the apartment my guest wasn't aware that there was a buzzer on the door came down stairs to let me in and the door dead bolted behind them! Absolute disaster. I admit it wasn't Liz fault that we got locked out. I've my own apartment in New York so I understand these things happen.
So my friend that lives around the corner has a spare set of keys just incase there's ever an emergency and someone needs to get into my apartment.
After numerous calls to Liz i finally got threw to Liz and apologized for waking her and told her the situation. She wasn't helpful at a all, her reply was that we should go book into a hotel and she'd refund us for the night? Are you kidding me. All my belongings are inside my friend is sick standing outside wearing pajamas and no shoes in freezing temperatures. Eventually I lost my cool after 40 minutes and told Liz I'd have to call the cops if she didn't help us(my friend has also spoken to her and said ""do we have to break a window to get in"" inadmitbthat sounds a little dramatic but We were very upset and cold!) She then told us her friend lives in the 1st floor and we could try his buzzer. Why didn't she just say this in the 1st place?

When I returned to New York I contacted air bnb and the refunded me my night. Which I was pleased with. 
It is a lovely apartment and close to everything And what u can gather I had an unusually bad experience 

I understand that some things were out of Lizs control and the situation escalated quickly, I just wish she handled it better.
I will give air bnb a second shot but I will ask if the game spare keys if an emergency comes up!

894,-1,"Cindy is very friendly.
The neighborhood is nice but too far from downtown Boston. It is a cul de sac with no lighting. At 8pm the street is already so dark that hardly see anything .
In announcing the apartment it said that they are included breakfast cereals , but the second day of my arrival there were no more and nobody replied cereals all week.
The floor of the room was not clean, and all objects were sticky (sockets , windows , fan , lamp, etc. )
One of the windows in the room was broken and could not be closed . The last night I could hardly sleep because of the party noise of the house opposite.
If I go back to Boston, I'll look for another alternative to stay."
895,-1,"Tout est comme décrit.  Notre hôte, nous a indiqué les restaurants, épicerie. .. Il a imprimé les itinéraires,  bref tout ce qui nous a vraiment aidé à bien découvrir Boston.

Merci Edward. 
"
896,-1,"Laine is a very kind host, she met us upon our arrival and gave us muffins and orange juice for breakfast.  She took the time to answer our questions about the unit and about what to do in Boston. Laine was very responsive to us when we contacted her during the whole stay.
The unit is on the 3rd floor and a spiral staircase to the unit.  The apartment is spacious with 2 bedrooms, one with a queen bed and the other with 2 twin beds.  We stayed there for 4 nights.
It seems that the apartment was going through various repairs but not-yet completed, which are not shown in the pictures.  The walls have patches of dry wall repairs, some patched have been covered up with drywall mud but not yet painted.  At some places the repairs are still exposed.
The front door has one busted dead-bolt and another dead-bolt was added above the broken one.  The living room has an old sofa, the coffee table has one broken leg with a note taped to it to caution us.    There is an old tube TV with over-the-air channels.  The dining room has a dining table with 4 chairs, they are in good condition for daily use.  There is WiFi service but the speed is very slow.
The kitchen is spacious but not clean.  There is no microwave.  There is only one pot, a large size, and one pan, also large.  There is a wooden trash bin but no trash bag, we had to use the empty grocery bags to collect the wet and food trashes.  We used the wooden trash bin to collect the plastic bottles for recycle since they are dry.  There are four sets of bowls and dishes to use with enough utensils for the guest.
Each bed room has a fan since the unit has no A/C. The mattresses were reasonable firm and comfortable. The queen bed still has plastic cover for the box spring but the plastic got torn up in various places.  The walls in the bedrooms have patchy repairs therefore make them look old and not clean.
The bath room is probably the worst spot in the apartment.  The sink is very small without any power outlets or room to place any personal care items.  The wall has repair spots, the sink, the tub and the floor are not clean.  The bath tub drained very slow.
I had no problem with parking in front of the unit.  The street is quiet most of the time. Traffic on the side street could be noisy at night if you leave the window open.
It's a spacious apartment but not clean.  Furniture are old and some are broken.  The pictures do not represent the true state of the apartment."
897,-1,"Der Empfang war sehr liebevoll. Laine hat uns gleich Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und U-Bahn gezeigt. Pizza, Snacks, Getränke waren zu Fuß erreichbar. Ich kann nichts Negatives sagen. Die Verbindung nach Boston über öffentliche Verkehrsmittel war nah und gut zu erreichen. Ich / wie haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Ich / wir würden die Unterkunft wieder buchen bei einem nächsten Besuch von Boston. "
898,-1,Le séjour c'est très bien passé. L'appartement est plutôt rudimentaire mais propre et confortable. 20min à pied du métro. Laine avait tout préparé et était dispo en cas de questions. 
899,-1,"Beaucoup d'espace, près du train de banlieue et aucun souci de stationnement. Laine a été très disponible à nos besoins avant et durant le séjour. L'appartement n'est pas de la première jeunesse, mais pour un court séjour c'était suffisant. Il n'y a pas d'air climatisé, ce qui a été problématique puisqu'il y a eu une canicule tout au long de notre séjour. "
900,-1,"Le séjour chez Alex a été très agréable. Ce studio correspondait exactement à l'annonce. Il était idéalement situé, à proximité des transports. L'appartement en lui même était spacieux et bien équipé, propre et récent. Alex a été un hôte parfait, présent pour rendre service tout en respectant notre intimité. Je le recommande et y retournerai avec plaisir lors d'un prochain séjour à Boston."
901,-1,"voilà une merveilleuse façon de se loger à Boston façon Marina!!! L'accueil a été charmant, le logement original, quartier proche du centre, les bateaux passent, les ponts se lèvent à leur passage... vue imprenable, le top du paysage!!!! Et tout confort!"

903,-2,Ari is a very accommodating host. My flight was delayed one day but Ari extended my stay for an additional night very easily. The room is exactly as pictured and its location is hard to beat.
904,-1,Excellent séjour à Boston ! L’appart est bien situé dans un quartier jeune et animé. Ari n'était pas là mais il était joignable à tout moment et très réactif. Il a fait en sorte que notre séjour se passe pour le mieux !! La chambre était pripre et le lit confortable. Je recommande
905,-1,"Rosa and her dog, Mevil, were so gracious and generous.  Rosa made me feel at home within 5 minutes of stepping into her apartment.  She was also really helpful in suggesting transportation and she even let me borrow cold weather clothing because I came woefully unprepared for the harsh winter conditions they have had, and still have, to endure.  Mevil is the sweetest dog and is so excited to make new friends.  He will also be your morning alarm clock, if you let him.  Both of them have such energy and vivacity, and welcomed me with open arms to their home."
906,-1,"Lori nous a accueillis très gentiment et nous a tout expliqué sur le fonctionnement des équipements de l'appartement. Elle nous a également très gentiment offert bagels, gateaux, fruits, boissons pour nous souhaiter la bienvenue ! Cet appartement au 3ème étage de la maison est très confortable pour une famille de 2 adultes et 2 adolescents et par ailleurs joliment décoré. Sanitaires et douche impeccables. Il est possible de prendre son petit déjeuner et de faire une cuisine simple si necessaire. Le métro est à 5 minutes de marche et ensuite le centre de Boston est à 20 minutes. Le quartier est agréable et tranquille avec ses maisons en bois peintes de différentes couleurs.
Merci encore à Lori pour son accueil et sa gentillesse !"
907,-1,We had a wonderful stay in the apartment. Had a hard time finding where to throw the trash. 
908,-1,"Hôtes accueillants et agréables; ils nous ont donné de bons conseils de visite. 
Grande maison victorienne qui se trouve dans un quartier résidentiel très agréable et très proche du métro; on est à quelques stations du centre ville. .
Notre logement était au 2ème étage, ce qui n'était pas clair d'après le descriptif. Les deux chambres étaient confortables et la salle de bains bien aménagée. Notre logement était bien séparé du reste de la maison.
Quelques bruits d'avion la première soirée mais c'était dû à une orientation particulière du vent. Sinon très calme."
909,-1,"Appartement très sympathique fonctionnel et propre. Tout confort.
Hôte très discret. 
Il manque juste une chaise dans la cuisine si vous êtes 3.
Très agréable et pratique pour garer sa voiture en ville"
910,-1,"Slight difficulty in gaining early access despite assurance at booking that bags could be left early. Great location but disappointed that bed linen not available at 5pm.
Kitchen tap tripped constantly throughout our stay & very difficult to sleep with the noise of such. Host was advised by sms of this problem but never responded. "
911,-3,"The unit was not clean, in particular the bathroom and kitchen were grimy. Windows were dirty and blinds broken and needed replacing. The kitchen drawers and cupboard were full of repair materials and paint cans, so cutlery and utensils took up most of what little bench space there was. There was a paint tray and brushes on display next to the kitchen cupboard. The second lock on the door was broken and the other was flimsy, so the apartment felt quite insecure. The common entry area and stairs were putrid. Had we had more time, energy and money we would have walked out five minutes after arriving. Instead we spent as little time there as possible. We did not meet the host as he changed the arrangements."
912,-4,"Sean took a long time to confirm our reservation leaving us feeling unsure if we had a place to stay. When we got to the lockbox, there was another traveler waiting for Sean and she had been waiting a long time.

There is no top sheet on the bed—so we didn't use anything on top because it was unclear if the comforter was cleaned between guests. 

Overall, it was a strange and uncomfortable experience. "
913,-1,"We picked up the key after directions from Sean by email.  We never met Sean.   The good things about this room were the location, the price, the comfortable queen bed, and the hot water shower.  The negative things about this room were the creepy dirty stairs up to the room, the dirty windows and broken blinds, no light in the bathroom, the mattress on the floor was the second bed (which was okay) but we had to chase up bedding.  A stained duvet was in the cupboard.  We were sent down into a creepy basement laundry for sheets.  No tea towel was provided.  The picture is actually how it is but you can't see much in the picture.   The accommodation was bearable for two nights and as I said it was in a great location."
914,-1,"Boston apartment  
Apartment in a great location and only 5 min walk from station. Sean communicated well via email. The entrance to this apartment is quite shabby but we understand that it's a common area and Sean doesn't have a great deal of control over this although if it were my Airbnb I would make an effort to clean it a little. Its on the 2nd floor and there is no lift so may be difficult for some with large luggage. Although the studio is comfy enough it could do with some TLC. The blind in the bathroom is all broken and doesn't afford you full protection from outside which I found uncomfortable. The dead bolt on the door is completely missing, just a hole in the door and we felt the small door knob snib was not enough for us to feel secure leaving valuables behind. The bed was comfy and room spacious enough for two people. The towels were clean but they were very tatty with bleach marks and frayed edges. There was no tea towel to dry dishes and more importantly no hot water in the kitchen which makes me wonder about the cleanliness of crockery. There is a hot tap but no water comes out when you turn it. The kitchen draws were full of junk and it had minimal utensils. 
Other airbnb's we have stayed at have supplied some tea bags or coffee which this did not have so remember to bring your own. The neighbours were very noisy when using the common area and walls and ceilings paper thin. Remember to bring ear plugs. The studio needs a good clean. Dusty under the bed and there is mould around the bath. Also there was hair clogged in the bath drain. We were due to spend another three nights here upon our return to Boston but decided to cancel. This accommodation may suit backpackers but unfortunately did not suit us. We have travelled extensively over the years and sampled many types of accommodation so don't feel we are being fussy. "
915,-4,"Even before we got there we were confused by Sean telling us that the place we are staying at is not at the advertised address. 
The studio was filthy and  dusty!
The very steep stairs are hard to contend with if you have any heavy luggage and the whole entrance area is dirty.
We came in when we said we will, but the place was not ready. About 20 minutes later Sean appeared with creased, dusty linen that he left us to put on the beds, making us feel he was doing us a favour. 
The hot water in the kitchen doesn't work, the drawers and small closet are full of Sean's junk, so even the little storage space there is is thaken!
Most of the small amount of cutlery is plastic and dirty.
The door doesn't lock properly, because where a bolt should be there is a hole in thw door.
The kitchenette is so tiny that don't ever plan to cook there, even if you could scrape by with the utensils that are supplied. 
The bed creaks and the neighbours can be easily heard through the thin walls.
There are no cleaning tools, so we had to stay in the dirt.
The only saving grace of it is the great location."
916,-1,"L'appartement est comme sur les photos, agréable, et assez silencieux. Il y a tout ce qu'il faut à l'intérieur, et est très bien situé.

Nous n'avons pas eu de contact avec Sean, les clés ne sont pas remises en mains propres. Cependant le contact avec Sean est facile en cas de besoin.

Très bon rapport/prix/localisation.

Nous recommandons cet appartement.

917,-1,"Great location. But the room is quite old and the doorknob is half broken. Great place to stay if you are not picky on the ""oldness""."
918,-1,"Værten var venlig med at give oplysninger jeg bad om før ophold. Mødte ikke værten under opholdet.
Fredeligt og roligt område.
Køleskabet var beskidt og der lå mad, der var for gammelt.
Der var støvet på hylder og en beskidt pande på komfuret."
919,-2,"The room was MUCH smaller than anticipated. From the photos it looks like the table was in the middle of the all ready tiny kitchen, which is inaccurate from the actual layout when we stayed. 
Its a small studio, not for more than 3 people, SNUG.
The sheets, blankets and towels smelled musty. Every night we stayed I kept telling myself to call Sean for new sheets, but we were up and busy by 8am, so I never got around to it. But the smells were very bad. The shower was very dirty, it appeared like someone took a shower and forgot their used toiletries scattered in the restroom and left the tub dirty.
 We wished we knew the apartment was up a narrow stairway on the 2nd floor on a different block than advertised. It wasn't a big deal, but we did have a stroller we had to keep lugging up a smelly, narrow stairway. If any of us had any handicaps, those stairways and doors would have been an issue. Also, didn't feel secure with a faulty one lock door. I wish the deadbolt worked.
I only received one e-mail regarding check in. No response when I kept Sean posted about our flights. Never tried to contact him after that.
The location is GREAT. But the apartment itself is VERY outdated, dingy, smells a bit, and small. 
I wouldn't stay at this apartment again. If you can find something in the same area, that would be best. The location was very awesome! That's all this apartment has going for it.
"
920,-1,"We stayed for just one night and booked through the instant book. We unfortunately had trouble the day of check-in getting in touch with steve. The house is very nice, the room was large. Very close to a few restaurants and the metro. "
921,-1,"Tout c'est très bien passé. Le logement correspond en tout point à ce qui est décrit sur l'annonce. Célia et sa famille qui m'ont acceuilli ont été charmants. La chambre est un petit cocon bien confortable, un réel plaisir durant mon séjour. Jonathan est resté en contact avec moi pour savoir si tout se passait bien. Je tiens à remercier tout le monde d'autant d'attention. La ville de Boston vous acceuille à bras ouvert, c'est un exemple à suivre pour nous européens!!"
922,-1,L'appartement était comme décrit et les photos le représentent bien. Il est bien situé à +- 8 minutes de marche du métro le plus près. Stationnement intérieur avec un coût supplémentaire tout près et bien pratique. L'hôte répond à ses courriels dans des délais raisonnables. Nous avions suffisamment d'espace pour 1 adulte et 2 enfants. 
923,-2,"Space accurately described. Close to restaurants, bars, the Boston Commons Parking Garage, and the train. The people living above are rather noisy (walking, dropping things, dragging furniture) from the hours of 4pm to 11pm, which may interrupt any naps, fyi. "
924,-2,"The home was in a very good location in Boston, very convenient as far as walking to everywhere is concerned. 
We found the home to be a little small in a few ways, the shower was very tight for room and there was barely any space to hang clothes up. It was also very dark in there as there is no natural light coming through. 
One other small issue was the people upstairs were constantly banging and making noise, at one point I actually thought the Boston Celtics were playing upstairs. 
Overall not a bad stay but a lot of room for improvement.  5/10 for me
"
925,-1,"Très beau et confortable appartement en RDC à quelques minutes du plein centre de Boston. (seul bémol le stationnement d'une voiture qui dans la rue est impossible, parking autour à 35 $ en moyenne par jour).

928,-5," The condo is as pictured.   We did have an issue with the tenants before us leaving it dirty and not taking out trash.  Bathroom was dirty - very dirty.    It seems someone had a dog in the unit at some point as dog hairs were all over the furniture.   
I believe the dryer has some issues and needs to be cleaned.   It was full of water and dirt when we tried to use it."
929,-5,"10 out of 10 for location - the North End is historic and full of life with great bars and restaurants - although finding a breakfast spot was challenging.
This was our first experience with Airbnb, our advice is to read all info carefully and have a easy ready means of communicating with the host as Benjamin is an absentee host.
We initially had a huge problem accessing the apartment. This was a disappointing start, we did get things sussed with help from Benjamin.

""Techno Mancave"" would describe the space. It felt as if the last person had just left moments before our arrival as pizzas filled the fridge, dishes in the unclean sink, bench unwiped and rubbish in the bins. The bathroom was filthy and we were uncertain whether the bed had clean sheets. 
We also felt there was a lack of information and guest guidelines in the apartment. 
Expect a visit from lady downstairs to ask you to remove footwear upon entering the apartment, she appeared 5 minutes after our stressful initial entry.

In conclusion, location superb but lots of room for improvement."
930,-6,"We had a really bad experience at Ben's place. Ben did not tell us that his shower was leaking to the neighbor's apartment below until we were living in his apartment. More importantly, this means that Ben knew about the leak, which had been a recurring issue for months, but still he rented the apartment. Obviously, as soon as we showered, his neighbor knocked on the door. We and Ben's neighbor had to deal with the plumbing issue with the corresponding delay to our daily visits. What is more, the fix of the shower leak could only be temporary given some imperfections in the shower tile, which will take much longer to get fixed. If you still decide to rent this apartment, expect an email from Ben encouraging you to keep your showers ""on the short side"" just as he did with us. Unfortunately, the shower leak was not the only surprise. His kitchen lights and TV are programmed to switch on as early as 7 in the morning, plus he cultivates some plants in the kitchen with strong artificial light that also switches on twice every night, plus his fridge does a 'bip' sound several times during the night that wakes you up quite easily since the sound is loud and high-pitched. I know for a fact that there are equally cheap apartments but with fewer inconveniences in the North End area of Boston, so please check those before choosing Ben's apartment. Also, we asked Ben for a discount given the important inconvenience regarding the plumbing, but we never knew from Ben again. "
931,-1,"L accueil a ete tres chaleureux. A la moindre question, on nous a repondu tres gentiment et tres vite. Le quartier est modeste mais sympathique et la maison est tout pres d un supermarche. La maison est grande et tres fonctionnelle Le quartier est tres bien relie au centre de Boston ou on arrive en 15 minutes de metro"
932,-3,We as a large family renting this property were quite disappointed with our accommodation on our trip to Boston. We were under the impression that the house had 4 beds as advertised but in fact there were only 3 proper beds the rest of the beds turned out to be mattresses on the floor. The area is quite run down and we were advised by a nearby pub that we shouldn't be out alone after dark. Downtown boston is  around 20 mins on the train and the train station is a 5 min walk from the house. There is a supermarket & McDonald's nearby but not much else so we just used the house as a base but it was a pain getting back before dark every day.  On the whole I think the house was overpriced and we would not return to this house although it may be suited to a smaller  family/group.
933,-1,Host was welcoming and accommodating for our large group. Checked up on us but did not disturb us.
934,-1,"Pros and cons to our experience. 

On the pro side, the house is beautiful and location is great. 

On the con side, one of the beds was broken and unusable, and the host did not notify us before arriving. 

When we called about it upon arrival, the host told us to blow up an air mattress if we wanted privacy in a room. We didn't want to ask one of our guests to sleep on an air mattress on the floor so he had to sleep in a common area rather than a private room. 

These things happen, but it's unacceptable when you're booking for almost a week and the host does not offer the courtesy of a warning when a bed is not usable. 

The host did followup later and ask how he could make the stay more enjoyable but without a fix for the broken bed it wasn't what we were expecting. "
935,-1,"steve est une bonne personne, sympatrique, serviable  et souriant. l'endroit est très calme vue sa localisation, en plus il est tout prés du métro. "
936,-1,"Ce séjour de deux jours fut idéal. En effet, les hôtes sont extrêmement gentils et disponibles.
Quant au logement, en particulier la chambre et la salle de bain, tout était propre et spacieux.

Je recommande donc vivement ce logement !
"
937,-1,"You can't beat this location. The apartment had everything you expect from the description. Perfect for a short stay. I think a lot of these apartments are rented out to people so just know that it is not that quiet so if you are looking for a quiet retreat, this place is not for you. We were staying there on a weekend and it was very loud both nights. Luckily, we are dead sleepers. Overall, great location so big complaints here. "
938,-2,"In Boston for a new job and decided to Airbnb it for a while while looking for a place to stay. I stayed in several different Airbnbs in Boston. Here are my takeaways from the Maverick #12 unit:

Pros:
* Incredible location. Tons of shops/restaurants, easy walking distance to the Charles River & Copley T stop. CVS is on the corner for all your conveniences, like if you need a roll of t.p. (more on that later). OOne of the reviewers complained about the noise. I was here on a Friday and Saturday night and sure you hear a little street noise, but nothing was obnoxious and I slept just fine. If you're worried about noise, you might consider staying somewhere that is not one of the busiest areas of Boston. 
* The unit was very clean and un-lived in. The other 2 Airbnbs I stayed in were clearly someone's primary residence. This felt a bit more like a hotel experience, though it was missing a few kind of essential items (more on that later).
* It is totally remodeled. Having looked at several apts in the area to live in, this is rare. Most places in Back Bay are old and dusty.
* The shower was great, excellent water pressure and consistent temp, except one morning where the hot water was randomly broken and I was stuck with a cold shower. I alerted the owner and it was fixed same day (more on that later). 
* The kitchen has basic items. One nonstick pan, two small cutting boards, one sharp knife, some utensils, and bowls/plates/glasses/coffee mugs. 
* It does have DirecTV

Cons:
* Every Airbnb I've been in offered basics like soap in the bathroom, dish soap, and extra toilet paper. None of this here - expect to buy your own. Which kinda sucks if you get in late at night and everything is closed (the Walgreens a few blocks away is 24 hrs).
* The bed is a flat rectangular rock with smaller rectangular rocks for pillows. Furthermore, everything is covered in waterproof plastic that is very crinkly. Also, if you are 5'5"", expect your feet to touch the bottom. If you are taller, expect to hang off the bed. I think it's a full sized bed.
* Having interacted with a number of hosts now, I wouldn't call Alicia super responsive. Even though she got the hot water situation fixed the same day, I had to message her a couple of times to find out if she even got my message (or voicemails). 

Only other thing is that the unit is on the 4th floor so be prepared to climb some stairs. Didn't bother me at all but might bother some. 

If you're looking for something with a great location, this is your place. Just be aware of some of the considerations I've outlined. "
939,-2,"Notre séjour d'un mois chez Jill Hallisey s'est passé sans fausse note. Jill est simple, directe, positive, chaleureuse. Elle a son travail, ses engagements humanitaires, elle est très indépendante, mais elle reste à l'écoute et elle n'a jamais laissé passer une occasion de nous rendre service ou de nous renseigner tout en respectant notre autonomie. Nous étions à Boston afin de prendre des repères pour un roman;  après les heures de marche dans la ville, c'était un plaisir de retrouver cette maison tranquille, de prendre un verre sur la terrasse, de respirer sur la pelouse, de passer les nuits dans un calme campagnard. Le centre de Jamaïca Plain, à deux cent mètres,  est vivant et animé, il regorge de petits restaurants typiques et de commerces, on y trouve un fabuleux café-épicerie-restaurant bio, des fringues originales...  Le bus pour Boston passe à cent mètres, mais dix minutes de marche vous amènent au métro. Si vous aimez l'espace et la nature, un lac vous attend au bout de la rue, et le Franklin Arboretum, à cinq minutes de là, est extraordinaire. Autre point : le chat et les deux chiens sont bien vivants, les chiens sont drôles, toujours contents de vous voir, et assez obéissants. La maison et ses meubles sont patinés par le temps, mais les équipements fonctionnent vraiment correctement et l'ensemble est propre. en conclusion, nous recommandons chaudement ce bnb.

Nous n'avons vu Victoria qu'une fois en arrivant, mais elle a répondu à toutes nos questions et nous a montré les lieux. Elle a même eu la gentillesse de préparer la chambre un peu avant l'heure officielle d'entrée dans les lieux car nous arrivions en bus de New York un peu plus tôt. Je recommande vivement !"
942,-1,Brian and Dan were very nice. They were great giving us tips on where to park and fun places to go before a Red Sox game. I actually fell and fractured my elbow after the game and when I got home Brian got me some ice and hopefully didn't mind my crying too much I was in a lot of pain! Despite the unfortunate injury we had a great time in Boston. If you will be attending a game the location could not be any better! 
943,-10,"I’ve been in Boston for 2 months now and I have to admit: the city is absolutely amazing! I wish I could start my review of this apartment with such warm words, but unfortunately it was quite the opposite of “amazing”. For starters, I’ve never ever stayed at a place that dirty!!! It was extremely gross. When I arrived, Sa wasn’t present since he was travelling. My room illustrated this quite well by being completely entrenched with dust – big time! I found some really nasty dust bunnies all over the room, in, on, and around the radiator and scattered around the bed. I truly wonder if the floors of the apartment have ever seen a mop or a broom. Ever. As in the beginning of time to now. I don’t think so. However, that was not even the worst part. I could barely bring myself to take off my socks during my first bathroom experience. There is a bathroom mat that has never seen the inside of a washing machine and has probably been there since the first tenant moved in. Do not go near that thing! I’m not really fussy when it comes to cleaning, but this place was just too much. Everything was dirty and dusty and the kitchen was extremely sticky on top of that. No matter what you touch, it will always be sticky. Absolutely disgusting. On my first day I didn’t even want to use a glass, because it was sticky as well. The fridge is covered with splashes of fat and of I have no idea what else exactly…I really don’t want to go into more detail at this point. As I said, Sa was travelling when I came to Boston, he returned at the end of my 1st month. When he came back he was planning to stay at the apartment as well and wanted to sleep on the couch (it’s a really really small apartment). From talking to his current tenant, I learned that this is what he always does. But he doesn’t mention this fact in his description of the apartment. His tenant spoke with him about this and he was responsive at first. But then he came back and it was really just a very awkward situation. He came to the apartment during the day to cook on an almost daily basis. I can tell because whenever I came back home it was extremely difficult to breathe in the apartment. The air was extremely pungent. The ingredients he used when cooking smelled absolutely disgusting and instead of using ventilation to get rid of the smell, he lit Christmas-themed scented candles, which only added to the apartment’s natural musk. The amount of money I had to pay for one month’s rent was twice the amount the room actually costs per month, and it is not even close to the value should be. I understand that I was only here for two months, and Boston is expensive, but I learned of..."
944,-1,"Sa was a friendly host, and the place is very close to the Green Line! Tip for future guests: the radiator makes a bit of a squeaky noise at night, but that goes away if you open the windows a bit before you sleep. Thanks Sa!"
945,-1,Mohsen was great at connecting with us beforehand. Very clear about how to get in and the room was as advertised. Unfortunately due to an unexpected power issue we could not access the internet during our stay. However everything else was up and running. Mohsen's place is very close to the subway and it's a short ride downtown. 
946,-2,"The experience of living in Mohsen's house was great excludes the last day I stayed there. The painters came in the early morning and cause smelling terrible atmosphere. Even my cloths in the dryer got the paint smelling, which is awful. Otherwise, the location of the house was great, it is less than five minutes walk to JFK UMass red line station."
947,-1,"Beautiful accommodations in the heart of Boston.  Professionally listed and maintained, 24/7 concierge who were extremely helpful.  Great location in Chinatown close to bars/shops, within walking distance of transit.  Only gripes (which were really small in the grand scheme of things) was that the carpet/floors were a little dirty when we got there (just dirt) and no directions were provided for parking (it was slightly confusing to know where to go/what to do).

Not problematic enough to damper the experience and the host was very helpful."
948,-1,"This room is a steal of the century! Cheap, amazing location, and blows any hotel room I've ever stayed in out of the water. Made me want to buy my own massage chair :)"
949,-2,"La chambres est sombre et humide.
Nous avons eu vraiment froid dans la chambre et la salle de bain.
La chambre et la salle de bain n'étaient pas spécialement propres (malgré le fait qu'il y ait un montant pourvu à cet effet).
Nous avons en tout et pour tout vu Howard pendant 10 mn durant nos 4 nuits. Ce qui nous a semblé bizarre pour un hôte. 

L'appartement était très bien placé. Le wifi était très apprécié."
950,-1,"Eine schöne, praktische und geräumige Wohnung: Jede Menge Platz und alle Betten waren sehr bequem. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet, nur Besteck war etwas knapp - wir haben uns zusätzlich Plastikbesteck besorgt, alles kein Problem.
Die Wohnung ist für Boston zwar nicht gerade zentral gelegen, aber mit der T-Green Line ist man in ca. 45 Minuten in Downtown, das ist völlig in Ordnung - und die Haltestelle ist wirklich direkt gegenüber der Wohnung, was sehr bequem ist. 
Von Andy wurden wir sehr freundlich begrüßt, obwohl wir ziemlich spät abends angekommen sind; er ist auch sonst ein ganz unkomplizierter Gastgeber - sehr angenehm.
Alles in allem: absolut empfehlenswert."
951,-2,"This location was perfect for visiting Northeastern, BC, Emerson and Tufts. 
Unfortunately, Andy was having a lot of personal issues before and during our stay that made it very difficult to reach him. He would not furnish a phone number so I had to keep e-mailing him through airbnb to try to get any response, which in most instances took several e-mails and days to get a response. 
We had several issues with the unit once we got there and during our 3 day stay. We didn't know where to park; my 16 year old daughter had no window coverings in her bedroom the first night; there were no pots so we had to change our dinner plans; unit needs to be painted to cover glaring red marks on walls in most rooms; there was no cutlery; there is a coffee maker but no mugs; no recycling; front porch and yard are a disaster.
Also, Andy showed up at 10:30PM our first night getting my 16 year old daughter out of bed.
Andy and his wife seem very nice, but I did suggest to him that he remove this listing until he gets his personal issues resolved."
952,-1,"De verhuurders waren niet thuis, maar de (schoon)ouders hebben ons heel vriendelijk en goed ontvangen.
Het is een schitterende, heel romantische etage, met een prachtige torenkamer.
Alles was keurig op orde en schoon.
Er stond een bosje bloemen op tafel en in de koelkast troffen we eieren, melk en brood.
We hebben het erg goed gehad."
953,-1,"Great communication.  Great location, lots of great food nearby.  Parking was hard to find.  Apt was good but had a strange smell when you first entered."
954,-3,This apartment is well situated. But it's awful smelly and old apartments. The hostess is very punctuality and indifferent to their guests. I had a lot of displeasure to stay there.
955,-2,"As mentioned by other guests, the location and price combination cannot be beat. The kitchen is awkward, which may be annoying for some guests. I would definitely stay here again."
956,-2,"We were made very welcome by Torry, she provided useful information about transport on our arrival, and that was helpful. The apartment was in a fabulous location, central and close to lots of the tourist highlights of Boston. The wifi was excellent, but the TV was complicated. Unfortunately we were a little disappointed with the kitchen facilities. There were only 2 coffee mugs, the kettle had gone missing since the previous visitors, and there would be no chance of cooking a meal because the kitchen was so dark and small. There was virtually no toilet paper though Torry later told us there was some in the vanity. We don't remember actually seeing a vanity. We were asked to wash up but there was no plug for washing up in the sink. Torry was somewhat aggressive when I raised these things with her. "
957,-1,"Nuestra experiencia no fue para nada buena. Llegamos a las 13:00 y aún el inquilino anterior no se había ido. Según nos comentó Torry (la anfitriona)  el error había sido de Airbnb por tal motivo tuvimos que retirarnos por tres horas para que el inquilino se vaya y para que Torry limpiara el departamento, no teníamos donde dejar las valijas por suerte habíamos alquilado un auto y pagamos una cochera que la gente de Airbnb prometió pagarla. 
Pudimos ingresar a las 18:00 el departamento cómodo para dos sólo para dos NO para tres,  pero era una mugre todo sucio!!!! para colmo estábamos alojados con una bebé de 11 meses que gateaba por todos lados un verdadero ASCO. La cama rota!!!! tuvimos que dormir en el sillón. 
Sólo se destaca el barrio y la ubicación. No es para nada recomendable y menos por el precio.  "
958,-6,"We know this neighborhood well and understand what old buildings are all about...we used to live similar buildings one block over and also in the North End. I also grew up in a house built in 1695. So that you don’t get the impression that we are habitual complainers, in all our travels we have **never** issued a complaint for any place we have ever lodged…for anything. And we don't expect to be coddled either...we do primitive camping 15-20 days a year.

I am very sorry to inform that this unit completely failed to meet our lowest expectations. A $225/night price for small unit such as this implies a level of quality and cleanliness that was simply not met. The fact that this rental has a 4.5 star rating brings into question the accuracy and value of the AirBnB rating system. 

The building itself is run down. From the outside, it is the worst looking building on the block. This, it turns out, is also indicative of the inside. The interior common areas are also run down. For example: there is plaster decay depositing debris from ceiling in the hallway leading to your door. Once inside, the apartment is hardly well lit, as the title of the ad says and the over-exposed photos in the posting imply. The carpeting by the bed was filthy. To claim the unit works for up to three people is questionable, in our opinion. The bed is suitable for one adult only...which is why my husband slept on the floor with an inflatable backpacking sleeping pad. The couch is not suitable for sleeping on....even our 13 year old daughter who is not picky about sleeping arrangements had a horrible night's sleep. On the floor near where you have mirrors propped against the wall are exposed staples in the floor...I assume left over from carpet that was once there. With a black tile, black refrigerator, black counter top, black stove, dark flooring, and a very dim overhead light, the kitchen was difficult to see and work in. The refrigerator was dented and scratched up. There is a large amount of dust and build up next to and under the refrigerator and stove. The toaster oven sits right on the range...I would never think of turning on one of the heating elements for fear of starting a fire (is this how the knob on the toaster oven got burned?). Many of the floor tiles in the kitchen are peeling up. The A/C unit looks like it has been duct taped into the window. There is a lot of clutter in the unit…to the point we were afraid of leave something behind. With all this, we had to wonder how clean the towels, sheets and dishes were. The bathroom was the one aspect of the unit that we found reasonably acceptable.
"
959,-1,"I never met Sam but our communication was very clear and I had no problem checking in even I arrived too late. I managed to make myself some tea and overall it was good experience. 
Funny fact I must share. It was my first time in Boston. When I see the house from outside I told myself this house must be older than me. The moment I entered the house with that noise in the door and vintage deadbolts I was sure it was older than my grandma. "
960,-1,"The room and the bathroom were nice.  Though I did not eat any, Caroline had put out some healthy snacks and coconut water as well.    Unfortunately though, this has been an unpleasant Airbnb experience for me.  When I was about to go to sleep, I discovered that the bed sheets were badly stained.  I was thus unable to sleep in the bed and left at the crack of dawn.  I texted Caroline to tell her that I will not be coming back to spend the second night as per my original booking.   She apologized for the discomfort it caused but I thought I should still mention it here as that is not acceptable for any accommodation, let alone one listed as ""luxurious"" !!!   

I was also not able to log on to the Wifi despite multiple efforts.  All in all, this was my very first bad Airbnb experience. 

 "
961,-1,"Appartement très bien situé et agréable.
Marina est une hôte répondant aux questions..
Apppartement propre et pratique.
Le seul petit soucis pas de clefs à notre arrivée et à fallu lui téléphoner et attendre plus 1h pour avoir une clé apportée par un contact d urgence...
Heureusement tout c bien passé."
962,-1,"It is a great location but we were very disappointed when we arrived.  The apartment was not cleaned from the previous occupant.  The garbage was not taken out, the bathroom was filthy (hair everywhere),  nail clippings on the floor, dishes not properly cleaned, etc.

"
963,-3,"Its impossible to describe our horrible experience. To be short, Marina accepted our booking, we were charged for that and she didn't show up to provide access to her apartment in Boston. All my messages, emails, calls were without answer when we arrived. I think its not necessary to say about  discomfort of being in a different city without a point of contact! The only one thing we could do (staying with our luggage on the street) its just to find the hotel. At that time it was a big conference in Boston and we had to pay much more then we were planning just to have a place to sleep. "
964,-1,"Would not recommend Marinas Boston place: overpriced for a dirty, mouldy apartment. Bed was awful with major dip in the middle. Host communication poor, ignored my request for a partial refund, but did refund cleaners fee as I had to do the cleaning & new linen day we arrived... Good location, book a hotel or Airbnb in the same area if you can. "
965,-3,"I was surprised to find Marina's listing on Airbnb.  The photos of the apartment are beautiful, and yet the rate is so low. I was afraid that the listing was too good to be true - and unfortunately it was. The building, while charming due to being an old brownstone, is in terrible condition. The hallway is filthy, dingy and smells like rotten food.  The apartment itself was not much better. The sofa is stained, as are the curtains. The apartment looks like it was decorated with discount furnishings from Salvation Army. The quilt left of the bed was tattered, stained and very uninviting. I even purchased my own bedding to use during my stay and covered the sofa with a sheet. There were hairs on the bed sheets sheets, and the bed sheets were even freshly stained. I sincerely doubt the sheets were cleaned. The mirrors were dusty and full of finger prints. I washed any dishes before using them, as they were also not up to my standard of cleanliness. There is food in the stocked kitchen cabinets - and much of it is expired. There were even tampon wrappers and a panty liner on the bathroom floor. This apartment was dirty, neglected and not well maintained. Marina told me she would refund the cleaning fee. This has not been done. She did offer to have the cleaners come while I was in town, but this was just more of an inconvenience, as I had already settled into the apartment and had a full schedule. I found it easier to spend an hour to clean it myself. She wanted to have someone ""inspect"" the apartment, but taking the time out of my day to have someone do this after paying for a filthy place was not something I was willing to do. I want a host to go out of their way to make my stay comfortable, rather then question my complaints about their filthy apartment. I cannot express my dissatisfaction with this apartment and with the host enough.  I am truly shocked by how severely misleading her listing is and also how unaccommodating Marina was. The fact that she offered to refund the cleaning fee, yet still has not done so, is icing on the cake. "
966,-1,"Appartement typique de Boston dans un quartier proche du centre, restaurants et Starbuck à deux pas.

Edward est un hôte parfait, accueillant et nous a même glissé sous la porte un hebdomadaire français un matin. "
967,-1,Edward hat uns auch spät Abends noch erwartet und in die Wohnung eingecheckt. Bereits Tage zuvor bekamen wir von ihm die genaue Beschreibung betr.

Edward hat sich sehr um uns bemüht und die Kommunikation war toll.
Eine Wohnung, die ich nur jedem empfehlen kann, der mitten in Boston eine ruhige, stilvolle Umgebung sucht, aber trotzdem überall schnell sein möchte."
971,-3,"Gustavo tried to manage the Airbnb rental from outside of the state.  Unfortunately, he did not include his housemates in the process.  When I arrived, nobody opened the door for me until the downstairs neighbors finally rescued me.

It is completely unrealistic and inappropriate to try to host AirBnB if a specific host with a specific plan is not present!!"
972,-10,"Michelle seemed like a lovely woman and I can see why people would enjoy her company. However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is ""professionally cleaned"". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home. "
973,-2,"SPOILER ALERT: black mold, filth, trash, and a disgusting bathroom

So here's the deal, I paid a total of $110 and what I got was a dirty room and apartment that looked more like a college dorm. 

- the bedroom was filthy with things all over the carpet, trash laying on the floor and the trash can was full from other people, and everything was just generally dirty.

- the bathroom that is shared with another roommate was absolutely disgusting.

-there is black mold all over the drywall around the shower and cracks.

- the rest of the apartment is more like a college dorm with filth and trash and clutter laying everywhere, which makes it pretty much unusable.

- every surface is filthy and my girlfriend hesitated to even use the toilet.

- the toilet has a pretty nasty bidet that looks like it is 5 years old attach to it. 

- the shower tub doesn't drain well, so the filthy water was up to my calves before I was finished.

-there's no air conditioning in the entire apartment, the box fan that was set up by the bedroom window had dust caked on the outside.

The Host is out of the country which is why he has his room up for airbnb, so I had to deal with his roommate. He was pleasant, but it would have been nice to deal directly with the host instead of some roommate who isn't invested in the system. 

The thing is, if I paid $30 just for a place to sleep it would have been fine, but for $110 I thought my girlfriend and I would be staying in a nice place while visiting Boston for the first time. but what we got are good memories of Boston, and bad memories of our Airbnb experience.

For anything more than $40, I don't recommend ever staying here. Ever."
974,-1,"Der Aufenthalt bei Pam war einfach fantastisch.

Der Wegbeschreibung von Green Street Station zur Wohnung konnte ich in dieser sehr ruhigen, angenehmen Nachbarschaft leicht folgen und Pam sagte sogar einen Termin ab, um mir einen herzlichen Empfang zu bereiten (ich hatte durch den Berufsverkehr ein bisschen Verspätung). Es war als besuchte ich einen guten alten Freund.

Die Wohnung war sehr liebevoll eingerichtet, das Zimmer ruhig und hell. Am Morgen hörte man die Vögel zwitschern. Alles war sauber und aufgeräumt.

Pam war eine sehr zuvorkommende Gastgeberin, versorgte mich mit hilfreichen Informationen, Cafe und sogar ihrem Fahrrad, dass ich mir zweimal ausleihen durfte.

Ich kam nach Boston um uns hier für ein Jahr eine Wohnung zu suchen und Pam hat massgeblich dazu beigetragen, dass ich mich für Jamaica Plains als neue Nachbarschaft für meine Familie entschieden  habe. Ich freue mich, jemanden wie Pam in meiner Nachbarschaft zu wissen.

Nous recommandons vivement ce BNB qui dispose d'une localisation tres appréciable.

Ps: Les deux chats sont très mignons "
976,-1,"Bonjour
Notre séjour s'est très bien passé; nos hôtes nous ont attendu le jour de notre arrivée et se sont assurés que nous ne manquions de rien. Ils  se sont montrés d'une grande discrétion, donc tout était parfait."
977,-1,"Ursprünglich wollten wir vier Nächte bei Francine bleiben, aber unsere Reisepläne änderten sich und wir mussten die Buchung kurzfristig ändern. Das war kein Problem für sie. Sie hinterliess uns die Kombination der Eingangstür, so konnten wir schon früh einchecken und noch schnell ein bisschen in die Stadt gehen. Das ist das Tolle an Francines Wohnung: 5 Minuten bis zur Maverick U-Bahn Station, dann eine Station bis Aquarium, und schon ist man mitten in Downtown. Und den Flughafen mit den Autovermietern erreicht man auch in 5 Minuten. Francine ist eine aufmerksame und lustige Gastgeberin, und ihre beiden Katzen sorgen für Betrieb. Wir fühlten uns auch das zweite Mal so richtig wohl! Vielen Dank! "
978,-10,"When we first arrived after a long day of flying and then getting brunch, running around, and finally arriving to our building we weren't expecting to open the door to our room (our keys were mailed to us so we already knew where we were going) and find a different family! This upset us, frightened the other family, and made our long day even longer. 
Thankfully, the front desk clerk had master keys to the other units and said he would try to find us a room. Room #2 we walked in had yet another family and finally room #3 was empty and did have paper work with my name on it. 
We called the 24/7 emergency line and no one answered. Eventually we got a hold of someone at Churchill and after expressing my concern that we didn't feel safe (who knows how many keys are floating around??) all they did was apologize and say that never happens. An apology didn't make me feel any safer! 
That night was extremely hot so we were forced to sleep with the windows open as the AC wasn't working. Ever stayed near Fenway on a weekend? It's noisy and made it hard for us to sleep.
The next day I called again to complain about the AC and after Churchill called the building they informed us the AC won't be turned on until May 1st. 
The listing for the rental says """"our apartment offers individually controlled AC/Heat""... a little false adverstising?

This is just the hardest things we dealt with and I could go on, but will stop by saying that we talked to customer service and once again was just apologized to so I asked to speak to a manager. 

It has been FOUR days since I was told a manager would call me. 

Do NOT rent from this company if you care about customer service. I worked in customer service for over 8 years and I understand that mistakes happen, but also know that when problems arise the company needs to not just offer a simple apology and expect things to be swept under the rug. 

(I also have picture of the HUGE stain on the carpet, gross stain on kitchen floor, weird disgusting food running down kitchen cabinets, and dirty bathroom floor.) "
979,-1,"Phyllies nous a bien accueilli avec de très bons biscuits.  Nous étions en vélo et la maison était située tout près de la belle piste cyclable longeant la Charles River, c'était très bien pour nous car nous pouvions nous rendre au cœur de Boston en vélo de manière très agréable."
980,-1,"If this is the experience of corporate Airbnb, then I don't want to participate. Evidently, Flatbook manages/owns a number of units that they rent thru Airbnb. The pictures, particularly the cool, lift-like views were seductive, but the reality was cold, impersonal and cheap. I'd rather stay in a hotel for the same price. I would not recommend it stay in a Flatbook rental again. "
981,-3,"We stayed for three nights in the double bedroom and frankly found this a mixed experience.

Firstly, the place is good value for money based on other properties on Airbnb and elsewhere. It might be best suited the budget traveller.

Here were our issues:
1) Our room was smelly and stuffy. Especially the subway food smells from the store downstairs. We hate the smell of subway.
2) There are rules around cleaning dishes and pans etc after use, but they were not observed by the host when we stayed. Every time we went into the kitchen there were dirty dishes etc filling the sink and used kitchen stuff on the benches. We didn't feel comfortable using the kitchen facilities.
3) There were filled garbage bins in the living rooms for the first two days we were there. The living room was not really accessible for use by guests as the host was watching TV most of the time we were there and it is kind of set up as her office.
4) No space in the bathroom for guest items. The bathroom is small and has a fair amount of clutter in it meaning there is no room for guests to store items in the bathroom. On the last day we stay in the apartment there were a total of 6 people staying in the property therefore things can get a little congested and noisy.
5) The room is noisy from people upstairs and the host watching TV at night in the living room, albeit earplugs were provided by the host.
6) The double bed (fold out sofa) was a little small for us and could be more comfortable.  

We looked into alternative accommodation on the first night but were not able to find any, which gives you an indication of the expense and availability of accommodation in the area.  If we had found it we would have asked to move.

Understanding that there have been some great reviews of this place, we just wanted to provide the most balanced view on our experience.

The host was helpful letting us store our bags at the apartment on our final day and the communication was good."
982,-2,Bed was very uncomfortable and apartment had the waft smell from subway downstairs but it's ok if you are looking for somewhere to stop over
983,-4,"I would not recommend staying here.

Location - The apartment was in a good area as far as transit and walking goes.  I didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street and left my car for 2 nights without issue.

Bedroom - The bedroom was tiny.  The picture is just about the entire room.  The apartment is just above a Subway and the smell of bread was extremely strong.  The Subway also plays music starting sometime around 6:00 - 6:30 AM and it woke me up each morning.

Bathroom - The bathroom was shared, which is awkward in some instances but overall not terrible.  Problem is the bathroom was gross.  There was hair everything and a huge clump in the drain that swirled around when I turned the shower on.  I was so grossed out from the shower that I did not even shower the last morning.

Cleanliness - The bedroom was clean but that is it.  I already mentioned the bathroom but the apartment itself wasn't overly clean either.  In the middle of the living room there was a huge rack where the host was drying her pants.  I wouldn't care too much that the place was a bit messy but the host had a rule about no shoes and asked us to wear these ridiculous ""sandals"" around the place.  

Friendliness - I would not classify the host as friendly.  She wasn't rude but definitely wasn't nice.  Every encounter was awkward.  I asked if I could store my bike on her patio and she just flat refused.  Her patio is quite large and empty.  She just wasn't very accommodating. 

Sleeping - The room was listed as sleeping three but what we found was one ""bed"" and one air mattress.  The bed was not comfortable and the air mattress is an air mattress.  I would not recommend staying here with more than two guests.

Overall - I would not recommend that you stay here.  I was looking for alternative places to stay as soon as we ""checked in"" but on such short notice I wasn't able to find anything.  Next time I travel to Boston I will absolutely not considering staying here again no matter the price.  

Final Note - I honestly felt that the profile for this place is borderline false advertising.  The room doesn't really sleep three, it's not cozy at all (it's tiny), it smells of Subway (not in a good way), the host isn't friendly, and the host isn't very accommodating.  If you have a choice, choose to stay elsewhere."
984,-1,"We had a very bad experience at Alexandra's apt : dirty dishes in the kitchen making it not usable, hairs on the floor of the bedroom and everywhere in the bathroom : sink, bathtub, hairballs by the cleaning products, overspilling bin in the bathroom. The living room was such a mess it was inaccessible for the 3 days we were there. The balcony wasn't accessible for guests either. The AC was running loudly the whole night. More guests were staying in the other room, making us feel like in a crowded dirty hostel. The window in our room was tiny and looking at a wall a meter away, giving a very claustrophobic feeling to the whole experience."

988,-1,Hôte discret et disponible.  Tres bien situé pour un séjour à Boston.  Le métro est au coin de la rue.  Les photos sont représentatives. Prévoir une alternative pour le stationnement de jour en semaine. 
989,-1,"Derian nous a transmis toutes les informations utiles avant notre arrivée. La chambre et la salle de bain étaient propres et agréables, tout s'est bien déroulé."
990,-1,I gave this listing a 5 star so that everyone else can see that this is a SCAM!!! She advertises an apartment that isn't hers. Also she cancels the day of and did not reimburse me my money. This is a scam do not book!!! 
991,-2,"It was one of my worst experiences!!! After arriving ,and checking in with front desk(security) , we were told airbandb is not allowed in this building!!! When we tried to reach Katie Beth didn't get a response till the next day.... When she told us she had the flu and wan't able to help us. FYI she doesn't own apartment!!! Her friend Tim does.BE CAREFUL ITS A SCAM"
992,-1,"Although Yair was very nice, we unfortunately did not have the best experience. We encountered countless cockroaches during our stay. We also got moved to a different room than the one listed, which wouldn't have been a problem had there been an AC unit in that room (both of the other rooms each had their own units). Hopefully this was an isolated incident, and we wish Yair the very best! "
993,-3,"My wife and I stayed at Alan's apartment for only 1 out of the 3 nights we reserved because we felt uncomfortable before the second night.  The day after we arrived, we were contacted in the afternoon and informed that maintenance was going to come in to do a non urgent fix that evening.  When we requested that maintenance be rescheduled, we were denied.  My wife and I then went home to put away our valuables and take pictures of how we left our stuff before leaving the apartment for maintenance.  When we arrived back at the apartment, we found our bags had been tampered with.  Mine had been picked up, moved, and turned around before being put back in its place.  I considered that perhaps mine was moved to clear a walkway for the maintenance crew, except that my bag was under a counter where no one would walk, and that my pile of stuff that was in front of the bag and that would have been more of a hazard was untouched and left in the middle of the walkway.  After feeling too uncomfortable to sleep/stay in the apartment, we checked into a hotel that night.

When someone is made uncomfortable in someone else's home, they should not be expected to stay.

Alan has denied our request for a refund of the last 2 nights and we are currently in contact with him through the resolution center and awaiting airbnb's decision.

If you wish, you could give Alan the benefit of the doubt because we have not found anything to be missing, but we feel that we should not have been put into such an uncomfortable situation and he should have at least rectified the situation by approving a refund of the nights we did not stay there."
994,-3,"It is unpleasant experience in Boston. The apartment is far away with the description. Old and not hygiene. The bed sheet and quilt cover seems not changed very often. After I complained, the landlord got new beddings for us. But still feel bad. Nobody clean the trash and change the washing towel except you made a special request.  a huge cockroach was fond and made us scared."
995,-4,"The listing was not accurate, the room looks nothing like the room that was posted and was located in a basement which was very stuffy with a funny smell. I have to keep the fan on all nights otherwise it becomes hard to breath. In addition the entrance to the house was very unkempt. This was an awful experience. 
When I reported the problem, the woman who communicated with me was apologetic and discounted one night of the two nights that I paid for.  "
996,-1,"Un très bon séjour dans une tres belle maison victorienne dans la verdure et dans un quartier très agréable. Le métro pour se rendre à  Boston et Harvard directement est tout prêt de la maison. On ne perd pas de temps pour les visites.  La maison est tres accueillante. La chambre est très agréable avec un lit très confortable. Le breakfast est délicieux avec tout ce qu'il faut à disposition. 
Dommage que nous n'ayons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer nos hotes mais nous étions en visite du matin au soir.  Un inconvénient malgré tout car une voie rapide passe  non loin de la maison et est assez bruyante si les fenetres sont ouvertes, ce qui est le cas en juin.  Et puis  pour notre dernier matin nous avons eu droit au passage de la tondeuse sous nos fenetres a partir de 7h45. 
Difficile que tout soit parfait. En dehors de ces problemes de bruit, c'est un excellent séjour et je recommande cet endroit chaleureusement. Les informations pour arriver jusqu'à la maison et se garer sont tout à fait précises. 
Lydie, Paris, France"
997,-1,"Notre hôte nous attendait et nous a parfaitement expliqué le fonctionnement de la maison. Tout était conforme au descriptif. L'endroit est merveilleux. Une maison magnifique, des hôtes charmants, tout le rez-de-chaussée est consacrée aux hôtes avec une cuisine et un salon, de sorte que l'on se sent chez soi. Le quartier est magnifique et déservi par la ligne de métro qui mène directement au centre ville et au quartier historique."
998,-1,"Mary und Barney haben uns vorher sehr gute Beschreibungen für die Anfahrt, das Zimmer und das Einchecken geschickt, falls niemand da ist. Das Zimmer und das Badezimmer waren sehr schön und sehr sauber. 
Die Gegend ist wunderschön und ruhig und trotzdem ist man schnell im Zentrum (ca. 8 Minuten zu Fuß bis zur Metro, und ca. 10 Minuten Metrofahrt ).
In der Küche gab es Saft, Kaffee, Tee, Milch und sehr leckere Muffins und Müsli. Vielen Dank! Wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt.
"
999,-4,"The general atmosphere was clean, the lobby was modern and the location central. Unfortunately we experienced an incredibly loud and disruptive floor well into the a.m. both nights. From 9:30 p.m. until after 2:30 a.m. someone consistently slammed their door every 15-20 minutes moving in and out of the building. Despite a request to respect residents in the property brochure (there are quite a few people who call this location a permanent home), we encountered loud noises, slamming doors and loud conversations through paper thin walls long after midnight. There was no enforcement of quiet hours, no warning posted in the rooms and no mention of a noise policy at check-in. Even at a hostel, it's unusual that one needs to employ white noise, headphones AND two pillows in order to get a few hours of sleep at 3 a.m. on a Monday/Tuesday. I will say that the staff did a great job running security during a loud, aggressive argument happening next door around 1:30 a.m. But I don't believe any of the reviews on here truly prepared me for the lack of sleep I got staying here. Perhaps I was on the wrong floor, but I was definitely disappointed (and tired) by the time we checked out."
1000,-3,"The apartment is very central, it was fairly large, and the beds and bedings were clean and comftable. 
However the apartment as a whole was in somewhat rough shape - such as large areas of water damage on the ceiling, and walls badly in need of paint.
In addition the apartment had been cleaned to a very low standard - with much dirt and grime in the corners, trim, refrigerator, and dishwasher
Worst of all the showers apparently had not been cleaned at all since the last guests and still had hair in them. 
We ended up buying cleaning suppliies and cleaning up the apartment the first night we were there."
1001,-5,"Kim was out of town during our stay.  Communication was mainly through one phone call and texts with the property manager, Talal.  We arrived early from a red-eye flight.  Kim and Talal advised us to leave our luggage at a local market and we were grateful for the owner allowing us to leave our personal property with him.

Location of the apartment was ideal.  We were across from Boston Common and within a half mile from Quincy Market.  Park Street and Downtown Crossing were the closest train stations and the North End was a fifteen minute walk.  CVS was across the street and a nice market, Roche Bros was a five-minute walk for any necessary groceries.

The apartment was located in an older building on the fifth floor.  Kim advised two clubs were in the building, one in the basement and the other on the first floor. The music didn't bother us because we were so tired from walking all day.  Entry into the building was confusing because you entered the main doors into a small food court.  Once inside the food court was another keypad door leading to the elevator and stairwell.  One gripe was the unsteady elevator which was overdue for an inspection.  The elevator was broken 90% of the time.  Walking up steep steps to the fifth floor can be a nuisance and cumbersome if you're carrying your luggage or groceries.  

The apartment itself was unkempt.  Paint was peeling off the ceiling in one of the bedrooms and the laundry room was a bit untidy.  We bought a few cleaning supplies to freshen up the place.  Overall, considering the location of the apartment, everything was good.  If I were to come back, I may stay here again."
1002,-2,"The location, apartment and cost were great! The entrance to the building and ground floor felt sketchy and smelled bad. The apartment was on the fifth floor and the elevator was not working. We heard it hadn't worked since January. The music from the club in the basement made it difficult to sleep on Saturday and Sunday nights."
1003,-1,"Elevator was broken and we were on the 5th floor. That was a long walk up with our luggage. 
Neighborhood was centrally located, close to the subway. "
1004,-1,"Localisation parfaite, tellement centrale. Rebecca a tout fait pour faciliter notre arrivée, même si nous ne l'avons pas rencontrée. L'appartement est spatieux, propre, et très bien équipé. Mieux pour 4 que pour 6 personnes car on est mieux dans un vrai lit que dans un canapé-lit dans le salon, mais pour quelques nuits, ce n'est pas un problème. 2 critiques: l'ascenseur est en panne depuis des mois, et l'appartement est au 5ème étage, et l'air conditionné fait beaucoup de bruit.
Mais si nous revenons à Boston, nous retournerons chez Rebecca! Merci Rebecca"
1005,-1,"Disponibles et attentionnés, Gaurav et sa famille nous ont accueilli chaleureusement. 
La chambre est très propre, spacieuse et la sbd privée est parfaite. Leur maison charmante est située ds un quartier calme à 5 min en voiture de Harvard square.  Proche de Boston downtown, le logement est idéal.
Tout est parfait. 
Je recommande ce logement pour un séjour à Boston. 
Merci à Gaurav et sa famille pour leur gentillesse et discrétion pendant notre séjour."
1006,-1,"The space of the basement apartment was very large and everything that I needed was there. Juliet was very easy to contact and very helpful throughout. The only slight negative was that if anyone stays upstairs it can sound very loud. This didn't detract from my stay personally but anyone who is a light sleeper may have issue. 

The area is nice and surburban and doesn't take very long to walk to a bus stop/subway station. Would definitely stay here again."
1007,-1,This was my first time in Boston and this place was exactly what I was looking for. Juliet provided all the information I needed about places in the neighborhood and how to get around. I had no problems getting to downtown Boston and I was even able to catch a Red Sox game. I would definitely stay again.
1008,-1,"we loved the amenities and cleanliness, unfortunately it didnt make up for the uninsulated ceiling and the commotion we heard upstairs till 2:30 AM and them 8:45 am.  We checked out asap in the AM due to noise, and never heard from Juliet again despite our comments."
1009,-1,"Famille avec 2 enfants avons passe 5 jours fin juillet .Tres agreable sejour a Boston, appartement propre, fonctionnel,calme,bien situe pour visiter Boston."
1010,-1,"Wir haben eine wunderbare Woche in Boston verbracht. In Curtis Wohnung haben wir uns sehr wohlgefühlt, wir haben alles wie beschrieben vorgefungen. Die Wohnung ist sehr gut ausgestattet, in der Küche ist alles vorhanden!
Wir haben keine öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel benutzt, was aber wohl kein Problem ist. Wir sind immer mit dem eigenen Auto gefahren, parken ist allerdings schwierig und teuer. Von Boston aus haben wir Ausflüge nach Cape Cod, Portsmouth, Cambridge gemacht.
Wir hatten 7 Tage perfektes Spätsommerwetter was den Aufenthalt in dieser wunderbaren Stadt gekrönt hat!!"
1011,-3,Did not meet the owner. Location is poor and access difficult because of stairs to get to third level. Were disappointed nothing wsa provided for coffee or tea.
1012,-1,"Just deeply DISAPPOINTED!!! We had booked the appartment for 5 person (which is more expensive than just booking for 2). Curtis knew that we arrive with 5 adults. The first thing we reconized was the smell in the whole building. It was like a mixture of cat litter and old stuff, which was just spicy in your nose. When we came into the appartment the smell was there too, not that intensive but annoying. So we checked the rooms and had to search for the fifth possibilty to sleep at. An adult person would never fit into the couch, which you can see on the picture but Curtis wrote me that someone can sleep there aswell. 
Also there was just 1 towel in the bathroom for 5 person. And we had to sleep with two people (with one sheet and not a blanket) on one of the singlebeds, which was horrible, because they aren´t comfortable even with just one person on it. 
For breakfast we had first to clean the plates and cups, because we did not to eat the old crumbs of strangers. 
So I have asked Curtis for what we have paid a daily rate for FIVE person when nothing is prepared for FIVE person. And why we have paid an amount for cleaning, when the apartment is not clean... So I gave him the chance to make me happy with reducing the amount after our stay and not getting this feedback. Just telling me that he is sorry about that and wishing me a good day is very disappointing! 
Another thing is: Do not expect that the bathroom looks like on the picture. The joint between the tiles are brown and ugly and the smell in the bathroom is stronger than in the other rooms.
A good advice from my side: Invest your money in a hotel and not into this apartment! If I pay for 5 people I expect that there are 5 possibilities which I can use! 
Conclusion: Boston is a very nice city, but book a room in a hotel and not this apartment! "
1013,-1,"L'appartement est nickel, tout équipé, très sympa ! Et nous avons récupéré les clefs, les instructions, le wifi... sans le moindre problème.

Un poil loin du métro et un peu excentré, mais comme nous étions en voiture ça n'a pas posé problème (et il y a une grande surface et un liquor store vraiment pas loin ! ^^)
"
1014,-2,"Cynthia est une excellente hôtesse. elle c'est assuré tout au long de notre séjour que tout était a notre goût et qu'il nous manquait de rien. l'appartement était exactement comme sur les photos, confortable, tranquille et très propre. 
Très prêts du metro, ce fut facile de visité la ville sans utilisé la voiture. Nous avons pu d'ailleurs laisser la voiture stationer sans frais, dans la rue.  je vous le recomande "
1015,-2,"I got the place because it was convenient and only a walking distance from BIMC.
However; I think it's way over priced I paid 6k for a one month stay and had to pay extra for parking . The whole building smells so bad. It takes forever to get on the elevator and when you do finally get on one you're like a sardine with 8 Indians from India or Arabs.
There was a sewage leak in the hallway for like 5 days.
For the amount of money I paid you'd think that you would have a washer or dryer but no. Also The bed was extremely uncomfortable. And college kids on the floor were loud most nights! 
Looking back i should've booked a hotel. It would've cost the same for a much pleasant experience.

1016,-1,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Todd. Alles war sauber und komfortabel eingerichtet. Als wir ein kleines Problem mit dem Schließen des Fensters hatten, hat Todd auf Anfrage sofort jemanden vorbei geschickt, um das Problem zu beheben. Todd war immer per Mail zu erreichen und hat schnell geantwortet. Der Zugang zum Haus verlief reibungslos. Das Haus ist auch mit öffentlichem Nahverkehr gut zu erreichen, wenn man raus hat welche Bus-und Bahnlinien wo fahren. "
1017,-1,Everything was great until my room was broken into and my things were stolen including my laptop!!!
1018,-1,"Merci à Bruce et Barry pour leur accueil. Nous avons passé un excellent(mais court)  séjour en septembre dernier à Boston et ce grâce aux précieux conseils de Bruce. Très belle maison ancienne, décorée avec beaucoup de goût. La chambre et le petit jardin d'hiver ont été un vrai havre de paix ! Nous avons vraiment envie d'y retourner, afin de découvrir la région et la ville qui est très belle.Très bon restaurant recommandé par nos hôtes. Bref, c'est vraiment un coin idéal pour décompressé tout en étant proche de la ville. Petite plage juste à coté. Parking pour la voiture et le métro est tout proche de la maison (5 minutes environ). Bon séjour et merci encore à Bruce et Barry."
1019,-1,"This apartment was nice and clean, the beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was safe.  However the Airbnb description of this place is NOT accurate in several areas.  

First no where does it mention that you have to climb 2 sets of stairs to get to the apartment.  This place is supposed to be kid friendly but with a 1.5 year old, it was difficult and dangerous carrying a stroller and baby up the stairs.  The outside stairs are metal (like a fire escape) and in the rain and snow were a bit treacherous with a baby. 

The next misrepresentation is that the bathroom has a beautiful tiled tub and shower.  NO TUB and nothing special about the shower or bathroom at all.  

The last complaint I have is about the neighbors.  They partied until late on both Friday and Saturday nights with loud music and marijuana smell invading our apartment, especially the bedrooms. 

I would consider renting again from Airbnb but not this place.  It would be best for people without children.  I noticed that another person complained about the stairs back in January 2016.  Either I had not seen this review or it was posted after I booked this place.  Either way, the description of this unit needs revised.  It still does not mention that you have to go through a side alley, past the trash, up a metal flight of stairs and then up a steep set of interior stairs in order to reach the front door.   PLEASE REVISE THIS LISTING!"
1020,-1,"Apartment was ok. Unfortunately, we didn't meet Jilian. "
1021,-1,Tout était comme sur la photo. Nous le recommandons sans aucune hésitation.
1022,-1,"Es war wirklich schön  bei Cindy zu wohnen! In der Nachbarschaft wohnen einige junge Menschen und auch im Haus konnte man viele nette Leute kennen lernen! 
Das Zimmer war geräumig und mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht :)
Die Küche, welche allen zur Verfügung steht war immer sauber und auch das Bad und die anderen Zimmer wurden regelmäßig geputzt!
Cindy ist eine tolle Gastgeberin und immer zu erreichen falls es mal ein Problem gibt.
Ich habe den Aufenthalt wirklich sehr genossen!
Danke :)"
1023,-1,"Great pad, his friend met us with the key within moments of our arrival in Bean town.

Top floor, great roof patio, projector and blu ray selection top notch (we did Tin Tin and Schenectady(sp?), NY). All facilities top notch.

Crazy nerdy book selection. Weird self-closing box with toggle switch."
1024,-2,"The place was nice, except that it smelled badly of smoke. If I had known that up front, I would never have rented it."
1025,-3,"The room itself was clean and locked from the inside. The closet was emptied for our belongings. There was a kettle with a Keurig on a small island in the kitchen; and there was granola and such. 

My biggest issue was with there being no towels for us and the bathrooms (there were two) were disgusting! The sink handles were falling off. Another issue was there were no ""quiet hours"" observed by the others who reside there. 

I believe whoever is running this may not have their people organized to do their part of the work. I say this because the guy that seemed to be the caretaker was nowhere to be found most of the time. Even when the smoke alarm went off at 4 am! I know it's beyond his control, but his response was that his neighbors burn their Ramen. 

If Airbnb suggests that we're staying at a friend then treat your friends better. Your treatment of these friends was not what, I believe, your company is trying to sell."
1026,-1,"La chambre respecte parfaitement les photos et est spacieuse. L'appartement se situe dans un joli quartier mais tout de même excentré. Ceci étant, le métro est proche. Brett a été très arrangeant sur l'horaire d'arrivée et les règles de vie dans l'appartement sont très simples."
1027,-1,"Très belle chambre et lit très confortable! L'appartement se trouve à 10 min de la station de métro et à proximité de l'aéroport. Nous n'avons malheureusement pas vu Tom, car nous sommes arrivés tard et partions très tôt prendre notre avion, mais tout s'est bien passé avec Tom pour trouver notre chambre!"
1028,-2,Tom was so kind when we got in at 1am and had trouble with the key due to operator error! Would stay here again :) 
1029,-1,"It was kind of hectic. I booked the place 2 weeks in advance and was never sent details on how to get into the house. I messaged the owner a few times on Airbnb and didn't get a response. I eventually called the owner for details, on the day of around 8pm. He picked up and told me a bunch of details but I couldn't write them down so I asked him to text it to me. 30 mins later, I had no response, so I tried calling again since I finally was able to take down notes. No answer. I called again an hour later, it was 9:30pm. I had a 6am flight so I was dying to get in and sleep. No pick up. I text him, no reply. I call again 10 mins later and leave a voice mail, no response. I then had a friend call him on a different number and he picked up immediately, as if he was ignoring my text's and calls. When we got the details to get into the home. we made it in and got setup for tomorrows flight. Not once, did I ever meet the owner. There were no introductions or welcoming. In a lot of ways, this experience was so annoying that I won't recommend this place. Regardless of the location and the comfort of the room, it's not worth it to be unsure if you have a place to stay at 10pm when you have a 6 am flight."
1030,-2,"Booked the room but never replied to any of my messages and did not answer any of my phone calls either. When I arrived, I still could not get in touch with him and ended up having to book another place last minute which was very hectic with all my luggage (and wasted my day). I would avoid. "
1031,-1,Jil was very accommodating of our needs and kind to us during a personally stressful time.
1032,-1,"Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Dan en personne. Mais il était très accueillant par message interposé, et très disponible pour répondre à nos demandes.

Nous reviendrons avec plaisir."

1034,-1,My mom and I traveled together to Boston for a quick weekend trip. The city is great! So many fun things to see and delicious food to eat. Lisa was a great host! We had nightmarish megabus delays and didn't arrive until close to midnight. Lisa was nothing but kind and understanding. You won't be disappointed if you stay here! 
1035,-1,"Kristina est très accueillante et répond à nos besoins rapidement.

Tout était parfait! "
1037,-1,"Es war toll, bei Elita zu sein. Sie ist eine sehr fürsorgliche und freunfliche Gastgeberin."
1038,-10,"While this was our first Airbnb stay, we regularly travel. 

This was our worst lodging experience EVER.  Airbnb sent an email in advance asking to confirm w/ Bernie as host.  We did and also asked 2 questions about early check-in and/or a place to leave luggage.  In the only email from Bernie, he said the check-in was at 12 noon.  Bernie failed to respond in advance of the stay to the 2 emails (8/8/14, 8/12/14) and 1 voice mail message on 8/15/14.  We also sent an email on 8/15 to the Airbnb Help Center marked “urgent” – since we never heard back from our host – but we never heard from Airbnb.  Therefore, we made multiple efforts, including on the day of check-in to raise concerns.  Had Airbnb responded, we would've relayed lack of cleanliness and that the room was not as described.

At the office we were told check-in was at 2pm and not noon.  The person at the desk inferred we were lying until the email from Bernie was found that clearly said noon.  This was insulting.  

In addition to the poor attitude and poor customer service to even gain entry, the room was definitely not as described in both the narrative and the photos. 
1.Kitchen: The kitchen was disgusting, unusable and a public health hazard.  It consisted of a few appliances wedged into a sliver of a closet (photo).  There was black mold along the sink edges, and back of stove (photos).  Cockroach/vermin droppings were found in the cabinet above the refrigerator (photo).  Pots/pans in this cabinet were filthy (photo).  Kitchens typically have a coffee maker - none here.  Toaster was wedged onto an upper shelf of a closet, next to a hammer and stained pillows (photo).  Noone would ever consider cooking or eating anything in this room.
2.Room itself:  There were long hairs on the bedspread and futon that were visible.  Was this room really cleaned?  Room overall not as described – no usable kitchen; dirty, unsafe, and public health hazard.
3.Safety: hanging power strip w/ cords (photo).  This is a fire hazard, period.
4.Bathroom (photo):  The picture hanging on the bathroom wall had a wad of dust on the picture frame.  How long was this here getting bigger and bigger?  The room was allegedly cleaned immediately before we entered – if this bundle of dirt was there – what else wasn’t clean?
5.Building Security: In the morning, we found that the front door, that requires a key to enter, was propped open with a stack of newspapers.  This defeats the purpose of needing a key it is quite easy for anyone to just walk in.

We paid $286.00 for what we were led to believe was a studio apartment with a kitchen that included a cleaning fee.  The kitchen was not usable as described above and the place was not only filthy but contained black mold, vermin droppings and hazardous safety conditions.  Therefore, we are owed a full refund immediately.

"
1039,-1,Host was away and we had an email to inform us to pick up key from another address. This meant one of us had to wait with the luggage in the dark and rain as there was no one at the listing nor shelter. We feel that this was unprofessional as we were left on our own to negotiate the room and it's facilities.
1040,-7,"Conclusion:  Mismatch between expectations and reality. 
On the positive: The apartment has an excellent location, nice and quiet neighborhood, near the river for a nature walk, plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, many types of stores and services within walking distance.  People at the rental office are nice, straight forward and gentle. The first day  I  requested to re-clean the apartment and change the bed sheets which they did. 
However, my overall evaluation is: “disappointment“, mostly because it was short from my expectations. Since the strict policy for payments make no room for regrets (neither reimbursements), I had to stay and endure with the facts that I had this place to stay and no time to look for somewhere else. So, I decided (had to) to endure it.  
The disappointment come from the apartment itself, it is an old unit within an old and decaying building.  The building is the decaying unit of the neighborhood. The hallways and stairways have a dirty looking carpet and a rare smell. The apartment looks no clean – I let the people in the office know about my perception from the beginning. I realized that the age and wore of the apartment make impossible to be clean and/or appears clean, the floor is scratched, the kitchenette and kitchenette sink are old, stained  and wore.  The windows are rusty and dusty; the apartment is due for a refurbishment. Pictures posted at the site do not reflect this.
The internet signal, after logging in with the provided password, is weak, unstable and nonfunctional. It looks that the router is somewhere in the building far away from the apartment. This was constant for the 5 days of my stay. Looking at comments from previous users, this internet access and functionality problem looks to be a constant old problem.
"
1041,-1,"Would not stay again until the following are addressed:
-Upgrade sheets and towels- the ones provided were very rough
-Running water in the shower- the hot water dripped a considerable amount of water constantly
-A shower curtain liner is added
-Pictures of the kitchenette are posted on the listing- the sink and stove are virtually unusable 
-More cups are provided- we purchased our own plastic cups
-The rickety chairs are replaced
-Decor is updated

If these issues are addressed I would stay with Bernie again. You are 100% paying for location with this listing- stunning location on Beacon Street, very quiet, relatively easy key pickup (~10 min walk from pickup to studio) and the space is quite roomy for a studio. "
1042,-1,"after coming to the apartment last afternoon,we just put our luggages in the room and went outside to purchase some necessities. we did not have a careful check on the apartment. 
we went back in the evening,and found that the sanitary conditions are terrible……
the couch is full of trash,the cabinet is smelly,the pan is oily,the bathroom is very dirty. it is disgusting. 
what's more, the tap water cannot be closed completely,so it is noisy and we cannot have a good sleep.
we went to office several times to ask for help, however, it did nothing helpful. we asked to get refund, the administer told us the manager was not there, so he cannot do anything because he did not have the right. we asked him when the manager would come back on Sunday, he said it might be Monday. When we came the office on Monday, he said the manager would not come back until Tuesday. On Tuesday, we made a call and they told us the manager was in Florida and wouldn't be here until Thursday. 
We cannot tolerate it at all, so we moved out immediately. Of course, it cost us a lot.

IT IS ABSOLUTELY A UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE."
1043,-1,"Very easy to get to from central Boston, host easy to get in contact with even though we never met. Room was spacious but had a lot more furniture than is necessary. Worst part was lack of wifi in our particular room, wifi signal extremely weak so we had to use the common room in order to go online. Convenient and cheap, would stay again."
1044,-1,Un tres joli logement tres bien situé à boston. Dommage qu'il ne soit pas isolé phoniquement des bruits de la rue. Des travaux  au carrefouront aussi augmentés les nuisances .
1045,-2,"The check-in procedure is very convenient for travelers, as it is impersonal, so you don't have the stress with appointments if your travel gets delayed. We didn't meet Shawn, but to our problem with the Internet he reacted instantly (thanx for that). The apartment is a bit further away, but we knew that in advance and did not mind. There is a bus line in front of the house bringing you downtown, which is really convenient. The bus didn't always run according to the schedule, but as we stayed only a couple of days I don't know how frequent it happens."
1046,-1,"Nous avons passé un merveilleux moment chez Richard. L'appartement est très agréable et idéalement situé sur Commonwealth Avenue. La vue est superbe. 
Nous n'avons eu aucun problème pour le check in en pleine nuit, tout était extrêmement propre et nous nous sommes réellement sentis accueillis (une bouteille de vin, etc). 
Nous recommandons vivement Richard et cet appartement !"
1047,-7,"Even if this accommodation is near to the subway and at three stations of downtown Boston, I wouldn't recommend it. 
Hotel of 3rd class disguise in a room in a guest house. This house shouldn't be part of Airbnb because it doesn't respect its rules, principles. It's our badest experience in Airbnb.
From the outside, the crumling house and the badly kept garden seems abandoned. The owner didn't welcome us.
The inside : an old-fashioned decoration, and the most shocking, pieces of paper on each room (there are five) with number of room, number of people and name of the host (totally impersonal).
We were three people and had the smallest room and the only one with only one bed. There was a camp bed for our daughter with BLANKETS by way of mattress !!
Bathrooms and kitchen dirty : hair everywhere in the bathroom and in the kitchen, dirty dishes in the sink, leftovers of breakfast cereal on the floor.
Washing machines unusable because there were always full.
We didn't have any contact with the owner.
Her answers to our questions were harsh (not even ""Hello""), almost impolite. Roughly ""Get by yourselves !""
Do we have to conclude that cheap means that we have to expect the worst ?

"
1048,-1,"Shelley left the key for us outside as she was going to an event out of town, and because of our schedules, we didn't see her at all. A sticky note was on the door of the room we were meant to use, and that's it! Please note: SHE HAS CATS !!! This is not written anywhere in the listing, and it should be. We two very allergic-to-cats people did ok, though, by staying out of the house except to sleep (that room was closed off to the cats -- at least there was no cat hair around).

Later that evening, we brought back some groceries to microwave, but had trouble finding plates. Also, towels weren't left out, so we were unable to take a shower.

The bed was very comfortable, and although there's no a/c in the room, the fans kept the air moving on this very warm evening. 

We had to leave for an early flight the next morning and tried to be as quiet as possible, but it was squeaky. Hope we didn't disturb anyone!"
1049,-2,"The host didn't show up and I have never met her. She was out of country and she didn't heads up and notify before my arrival.
The house is messy and dirty.  No body at home until the 3rd day, her son came home and made the bathroom dirty and messy. "
1050,-1,"The stay here was fantastic in a fantastic location.  It is located just a block away from Paul Revere's home and right in the heart of Little Italy.  I had a slight issue with receiving the wrong key, but had the problem fixed within 15 minutes and had no problems after that.  Highly recommend the location and Dror!  "
1051,-1,Tres bonne localisation a quelques pas d un quartier annime mais aussi du centre historique. Comme dans tout Boston le stationnement de la voiture est difficile en particulier dans ce quartier avec la proximite des departs des excursions nautiques ...
1052,-1,"Vores første Airbnb oplevelse. Perfekt oplevelse. Specielt denne lokation i udkanten af Boston.
Huset er perfekt. Det ville have været dejligt med aircon.
Vi har altid tidligere boet på hotel. Det er slut nu !!
Det er sandsynligvis for dyrt at vælge Airbnb for enkelte nætter pga udgift til rengøring."
1053,-1,"La maison est très belle, nous avons été très bien reçu. La chambre est très grande. L'arrêt de bus est tout près de la maison. Nous sommes rapidement partout. Je recommande vivement."
1054,-1,"Il y a eu de la confusion dans l'heure d'arrivée. Dans nos échanges de communication, nous avions demandé si c'était possible d'arriver plus tôt (13h) et ça semblait ok. C'est par la suite que nous avons compris que un ""early-check in"" voulait dire 16h.  Nous avons été accueillis par un chien aboyant à travers la porte. Nous avons réveillé Mekkin qui dormait puisqu'elle travaillait la nuit précédente.

En dehors de ce mal-entendu, Mekkin a été très courtoise. Notre chambre était très spacieuse et très propre.  La maison est charmante avec son architecture impressionnante.  Le quartier n'offre pas beaucoup de services mais la maison est située à 5 minutes à pied des transport en commun qui sont très efficaces à Boston. C'est un bon rapport qualité prix pour Boston."
1055,-1,"l'accueil avec Alex, c'est plutôt bien passé, tout était décrit dans l'annonce. nous avons trouvé facilement. il faut savoir que c'est un quartier résidentiel avec peu de choses autour, mais il y a un metro à 7 min a pieds qui vous emmène dans le centre. L'appartement est agréable à vivre mais un peu sombre, j'ai fait aussi remarqué a Alex que la chambre était un peu humide, je lui souhaite de résoudre le problème. mis a part cela nous étions très bien dans son appartement."
1056,-1,"Logement conforme à la description. Bon accueil par une connaissance du propriétaire qui n'a pas manqué de nous attendre, de faire la visite et expliquer les alentours. On a eu un petit problème de chasse d'eau qui a été rapidement reglé. Quartier calme et proche de Prudential et du centre. Tout était à disposition dans l'appartement."
1057,-1,"Rob's house was good, but not exactly as advertised. I had to carry four huge suitcases up 3 flights of stairs and that really took a toll on me. Most of the food in the apartment looked it had already been opened. The wifi too, was really slow and laggy. The only upside was the neighbouring area as there was proximity to the best of Boston's shopping and culture."
1058,-2,"Jane a constamment pris des nouvelles avant notre arrivée et a fait de sorte que tout se passe bien , l'accueil a été très chaleureux .
Le logement était bien décrit . Le quartier est très agréable , près d'un beau parc ."
1059,-1,"The listing description was accurate and the place was exactly as expected.  Nice plus was the availability of grills on the third floor.  Only marked as 3 stars because 1) we had a day without electricity in the building and the next day there was no water, followed by very dirty hot water that had to be run out for 45 minutes or more.  Not the host fault, but the building.  I would not expect others to have the same problems."
1060,-5,"Do not stay in this place. 

My concerns started the first time I tried to contact Bernie after I booked. It usually took him more than one day to respond, but generally less than two. He would not give me information about how to get the key until a few days before I got there. He also did not answer all of my questions.

I had to get the key from a guest house, whose staff had never heard of him. It was a long walk with luggage.

The bottom sheet did not fit the mattress, there was long dark hair on the floor near the bathroom, the carpet had not been vacuumed, the shower head nearly broke off when I tried to adjust it, there was paint bubbling off the ceiling in the bathroom and when I went to use the towel, the towel rail fell off. It was very difficult to contact him about this - I went to the guest house to talk to him, but they had never heard of him. I tried to call him on his mobile phone, but that only got me through to the guest house. I had begun to wonder if he was a real person. I eventually was able to contact him and he said that the cleaners had been the day before, but he had not checked. They came again quite quickly, but there was still long, dark hair on the floor and again the carpet had not been vacuumed.

When I eventually was able to talk to him, he became quite argumentative. I did not like his manner. His level of customer service was zero.

The only thing this place had going for it was its location."
1061,-1,"Host was very welcoming. Willing to care for any issues that arose. Neighborhood was nice, busy street in front.
One issue- 6 of us overnighted two days and only 2 rolls of toilet paper provided. We ran out and had no access to purchase any nearby.
Plenty of towels provided; clean house, except floors were dirty. Our white socks proved it.
We would return to house if visiting Boston, but not Cambridge; traffic was terrible. "
1062,-2,"Die Wohnung ist in einen schönen, alten Haus mit viel Flair.
Super Lage und ruhig. Die T ist in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen, toller Supermarkt ""Whole Foods"" ebenso ""um die Ecke"".
Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Joe ist ein sehr warmherziger und freundlicher Gastgeber.
Wenn wir nochmal nach Boston kommen, werden wir auf jeden Fall wieder bei Joe übernachten."
1063,-2,"The location in Charleston was convenient.   Joe was very helpful with providing information and even drove one part of the group to the airport. the apartment is to small and inconvenient for four adults because of the tiny shared bathroom,Tiny fridge, and extremely limited kitchen. only one couple can watch tv and poor and noisy air conditioning. 
I wouldn't book with Airbnb again as I didn't realize they charge a $95 booking fee.  We felt that generally it was expensive,  considering the facilities. "
1064,-2,"Très agréable séjour chez Joe à Boston!!! :)

Joe est une personne très sympathique, et envieuse de partager des moments de discussion avec ses invités.

Tout était prêt lorsque nous sommes arrivés. Le 1er étage était entièrement à notre disposition, et Joe avait même laissé de quoi prendre un petit déjeuner complet (fruits, café, pain, etc).

La maison en elle même est située dans un quartier très sympa, tout proche du centre ville de Boston. Pour s'y rendre, deux solutions qui prennent environ 30 minutes : Soit à pieds entre traversant un petit pont. Soit en faisant une partie du chemin grâce à un ferry qui relie Charlestown à l'aquarium de Boston (plein centre). L'avantage du ferry est d'avoir une vue très jolie sur Boston depuis la mer.

Thanks for all Joe. ;)"
1065,-2,"Lovely furnishings as accurately pictured in the photos.
However, besides the bed and linens themselves, everything was dirty: the rugs, carpets, desk and horizontal surfaces dusty, visual brown stains on the couch and chairs - mold and mildew on the community shower/bath mat in the bathroom. If you are a teenager, college student or male in your 20's all this might be okay w/ you. As a female grown up, it was gross. Also: security - no locks on the doors, not even the community bathroom door! Window to fire escape left wide open in the bathroom - anyone could have crawled in. Noisy A/C unit, creaky bed. Upside: 1. had full range of cable channels, 2 it was quiet and 3 Doug who met me and showed me to my room was nice. And again, very cool, antiquey furnishings. I'm okay w/ ""funky"" I'm just not okay w/ ""filthy"". "
1066,-1,I'm glad Robert was able to accommodate me so last minute (an hour or so). The house itself is like a mix between old bookstore and antiquary: bookshelves and random sculptures/art in every nook and cranny (people with severe dust allergy might have some trouble; I'm mildly allergic but had no issue). The area is well located but also quiet (I stayed one Saturday night and heard no noise). I could not meet Robert but his roommate was friendly and helpful.
1067,-4,"I was quite disappointed in my stay at Robert's home home. My bedroom had a comfy bed, but there were no drawers to put my clothes in both closets were stuffed with boxes and paper. There were 10"" of space but no hangers to hang clothing on. I did get hangers when I requested them from his assistant. The TV was 15"" square and the remote did not work. There were no locks on any of the five guest bedrooms and only one working smoke detector that I could find on the four floors of the home. No one could enter the front door because it was packed with stuff so everyone had to enter from the little door under the stairs. I was most dismayed with the kitchen which was filthy unusable, and all surfaces were covered with stuff including the stove. I asked for some Kleenex for my room and I was given a roll of toilet paper. Someone tried to enter my room in the middle of the night and I yelled & they left. I shared the bathroom with two other people    As mentioned in the other reviews, the house and hall walls were filled with stacks of books. After two nights I just couldn't stay there anymore and abandoned my third night reservation. I called and emailed Robert to get him to try to rent my third night but I never heard back from him. "
1068,-1,Lorna was not very sensitive of our late arrival. We were traveling far and came to move my daughter out of her dorm room and I felt extremely pressured to arrive early due to the constant contact from her. In addition to this she was upset about us bringing more than two people despite us having rented both rooms and asked for specific permission to bring a blow up mattress which she had originally accepted.
1069,-1,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Steven. L’accueil qu'il nous a réservé était très chaleureux, il était toujours disponible pour discuter avec nous (en anglais ou en français!) tout en sachant rester très discret. Nous avons aimé échanger avec lui, c'était toujours intéressant. L'appartement est bien situé, à 1/4 d'heure de métro du centre de Boston avec une ligne directe. Le quartier est calme et familial, les immeubles sont jolis. L'appartement en lui-même est comme sur les photos. Nous avons particulièrement apprécié la terrasse dans les arbres où nous avons pu prendre tous nos repas. La chambre est grande et bien équipée. Nous vous recommandons sans hésiter cette adresse si vous devez aller à Boston! "
1070,-1,"Steven  ist  ein  sehr  hilfsbereiter  , freundlicher  Gastgeber,   Wohnung  sauber  ,  bot uns  an, alles  zu nutzen  was  in  Küche  gebraucht wird.  
Er hat uns  den Aufenthalt in  Bosten  sehr  angenehm gemacht,   Parken auf der Straße  kein Problem.
